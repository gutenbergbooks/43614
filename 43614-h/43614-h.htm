<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are none who know <span class="sc">Tirol</span>
but are forward to express regret that so picturesque and so primitive
a country should be as yet, comparatively with other tracks of travel,
so little opened up to the dilettante explorer.</p>
<p>It is quite true, on the other hand, that just in proportion as a
country becomes better known, it loses, little by little, its merit of
being primitive and even picturesque. Intercourse with the world beyond
the mountains naturally sweeps away the idiosyncracies of the
mountaineers; and though the trail of progress which the civilized
tourist leaves behind him cannot absolutely obliterate the actual
configuration of the country, yet its original characteristics must
inevitably be modified by the changes which his visits almost
insensibly occasion. The new traditions which he brings with him of
vast manufacturing enterprise and rapid commercial success cannot but
replace in the minds of the people the old traditions of the fire-side
and the <i>Fil&ograve;</i>, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e204" href="#xd21e204" name="xd21e204">vi</a>]</span>their dreams
of treasure-granting dwarfs and the <i lang="de">Bergsegen</i>
dependent on prayer. The uniform erections of a monster Hotel Company,
&lsquo;convenient to the Railway Station,&rsquo; supersede the frescoed
or timbered hostelry perched on high to receive the wayfarer at his
weariest. The giant mill-chimneys, which sooner or later spring up from
seed unwittingly scattered by the way-side, not only mar the landscape
with their intrinsic deformity, but actually strip the mountains of
their natural covering, and convert wooded slopes into grey and barren
wastes;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e209src" href="#xd21e209" name=
"xd21e209src">1</a> just as the shriek of the whistle overpowers the
J&ouml;del-call, and the barrel-organ supersedes the zitther and the
guitar.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Such considerations naturally make one shrink from the
responsibility of taking a part (how insignificant soever) in directing
the migration of tourists into such a country as Tirol. I have heard a
Tirolese, while at the same time mourning that the attractions of his
country were so often passed over, express this feeling very strongly,
and allege it as a reason why he did not give the result of his local
observations to the press; and I listened to his apprehensions with
sympathy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e216" href="#xd21e216"
name="xd21e216">vii</a>]</span>But then these changes <i>must</i> be.
The attempt to delay them is idle; nor would individual abstention from
participating in the necessary movement of events have any sensible
effect in stemming the even course of inevitable development.
Circumstances oblige us continually to co-operate in bringing about
results which we might personally deprecate.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;In whatsoe&rsquo;er we perpetrate</p>
<p class="line">We do but row; we&rsquo;re steered by fate.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And after all, why should we deprecate the result? We
all admire the simple mind and chubby face of childhood; yet who
(except the sentimental father in the French ballad, &lsquo;<span lang=
"fr">Reste toujours petit!</span>&rsquo;) would wish to see his son in
petticoats and leading-strings all his days. The morning mists which
lend their precious charm of mystery to the sunrise landscape must be
dispelled as day advances, or day would be of little use to man.</p>
<p>The day cannot be all morning; man&rsquo;s life cannot be all
infancy; and we have no right so much as to wish&mdash;even though
wishes avail nothing&mdash;that the minds of others should be involved
in absurd illusions to which we should scorn to be thought a prey
ourselves.</p>
<p>Nature has richly endowed Tirol with beauty and healthfulness; and
they must be dull indeed who, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e235"
href="#xd21e235" name="xd21e235">viii</a>]</span>coming in search of
these qualities, do not find them enhanced <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e237" title="Source: an">a</span> hundredfold by the clothing of
poetry with which the people have superindued them. Who, in penetrating
its mountain solitudes, would not thank the guide who peoples them for
him with mysterious beings of transcendent power; who interprets for
him, in the nondescript echoes of evening, the utterances of a world
unknown; and in the voices of the storm and of the breeze the
expression of an avenging power or the whisperings of an almighty
tenderness.</p>
<p>But then&mdash;if this is found to be something more than poetry, if
the allegory which delights our fancy turns out to be a grotesque
blunder in the system of the peasant who narrates it,&mdash;it cannot
be fair to wish that he should continue subject to fallacious fancies,
in order that we may be entertained by their recital.</p>
<p>It is one thing for a man who has settled the grounds of his belief
(or his unbelief) to his best satisfaction in any rational way, to say,
&lsquo;I take this beautiful allegory into my repertory; it elevates my
moral perceptions and illustrates my higher reaches of thought;&rsquo;
but it is quite another thing if one reasons thus with himself,
&lsquo;My belief is so and so, <i>because</i> a certain supernatural
visitation proves it;&rsquo; when actually the said supernatural
visitation never took place at all, and was nothing but an allegory, or
still less, a mere freak of fancy in its beginning. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e247" href="#xd21e247" name=
"xd21e247">ix</a>]</span></p>
<p>Perhaps if the vote could be taken, and if desires availed anything,
the general consensus of thinking people would go in favour of the
desire that there had been no myths, no legends. But the vote would
involve the consequence that we should have antecedently to be
possessed of a complete innate knowledge of the forces of being,
corresponding to the correct criteria, which we flatter ourselves do
indwell us of the principles of beauty and of harmony. If there are any
who are sanguine enough to believe that science will one of these days
give us a certain knowledge of how everything came about, it is beyond
dispute that for long ages past mankind has been profoundly puzzled
about the question, and it cannot be an uninteresting study to trace
its gropings round and round it.</p>
<p>Perfect precision of ideas again would involve perfect exactness of
expression. No one can fail to regret the inadequacies and vagaries of
language which so often disguise instead of expressing thought, and
lead to the most terrible disputes just where men seek to be most
definite. If we could dedicate one articulate expression to every
possible idea, we should no longer be continually called to litigate on
the meanings of creeds and documents, and even verbal statements.</p>
<p>But when we had attained all this, we should have surrendered all
the occupation of conjecture and all <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e255" href="#xd21e255" name="xd21e255">x</a>]</span>the charms of
mystery; we should have parted with all poetry and all <i lang=
"fr">jeux d&rsquo;esprit</i>. If knowledge was so positive and language
so precise that misunderstanding had no existence, then neither could
we indulge in metaphor nor <i lang="fr">&eacute;gayer la
mati&egrave;re</i> with any play on words. In fact, there would be
nothing left to say at all!</p>
<p>Perhaps the price could not be too high; but in the meantime we have
to deal with circumstances as they are. We cannot suppress mythology,
or make it non-existent by ignoring it. It exists, and we may as well
see what we can make of it, either as a study or a recreation.
Conjectures and fancies surround us like thistles and roses; and as
brains won&rsquo;t stand the wear of being ceaselessly carded with the
thistles of conjecture, we may take refuge in the alternative of
amusing ourselves on a holiday tour with plucking the roses which old
world fancy has planted&mdash;and planted nowhere more prolifically
than in Tirol.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>In speaking of Tirol as comparatively little opened up, I have not
overlooked the publications of pioneers who have gone before. The pages
of Inglis, though both interesting and appreciative, are unhappily
almost forgotten, and they only treat quite incidentally of the
people&rsquo;s traditions. But as it is the most salient points of any
matter which must always arrest attention first, it has been chiefly
the mountains of Tirol to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e269" href=
"#xd21e269" name="xd21e269">xi</a>]</span>which attention has hitherto
been drawn. Besides the universally useful &lsquo;Murray&rsquo; and
others, very efficient guidance to them has of late years been afforded
in the pages of &lsquo;Ball&rsquo;s Central Alps,&rsquo; in some of the
contributions to &lsquo;Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers;&rsquo; in the
various works of Messrs. Gilbert and Churchill; and now Miss A. B.
Edwards has shown what even ladies may do among its Untrodden Peaks.
The aspects of its scenery and character, for which it is my object on
the other hand to claim attention, lie hidden among its Valleys,
Trodden and Untrodden. And down in its Valleys it is that its
traditions dwell.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e271src" href="#xd21e271"
name="xd21e271src">2</a></p>
<p>If the names of the Valleys of Tirol do not at present awaken in our
mind stirring memories such as cling to other European routes whither
our steps are invited, ours is the fault, in that we have overlooked
their history. The past has scattered liberally among them
characteristic landmarks dating from every age, and far beyond the
reach of dates. Every stage even of the geological formation of the
country&mdash;which may almost boast of being in its courage and its
probity, as it does boast of being in the shape in which it is
fashioned, the heart of Europe&mdash;is sung of in popular <i>Sage</i>
as the result of some <span class="corr" id="xd21e279" title=
"Source: poectically">poetically</span> conceived <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e282" href="#xd21e282" name=
"xd21e282">xii</a>]</span>agency; humdrum physical forces transformed
by the wand of imagination into personal beings; now bountiful, now
retributive; now loving; now terrible; but nearly always rational and
just.</p>
<p>To the use of those who care to find such gleams of poetry thrown
athwart Nature&rsquo;s work the following pages are dedicated. The
traditions they record do not claim to have been all gathered at first
hand from the stocks on which they were grown or grafted. A life, or
several lives, would hardly have sufficed for the work. In Germany,
unlike Italy, myths have called into being a whole race of collectors,
and Tirol has an abundant share of them among her offspring. Not only
have able and diligent sons devoted themselves professionally to the
preservation of her traditions, but every valley nurtures appreciative
minds to whom it is a delight to store them in silence, and who
willingly discuss such lore with the traveller who has a taste for
it.</p>
<p>That a foreigner should attempt to add another to these very full,
if not exhaustive collections, would seem an impertinent labour of
supererogation. My work, therefore, has been to collate and arrange
those traditions which have been given me, or which I have found ready
heaped up; to select from the exuberant mass those which, for one
reason or another, appeared to possess the most considerable interest;
and to localise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e288" href=
"#xd21e288" name="xd21e288">xiii</a>]</span>them in such a way as to
facilitate their study both by myself and others along the wayside; not
neglecting, however, any opportunity that has come in my way of
conversing about them with the people themselves, and so meeting them
again, living, as it were, in their respective homes. This task, as far
as I know, has not been performed by any native writer.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e290src" href="#xd21e290" name=
"xd21e290src">3</a></p>
<p>The names of the collectors I have followed are, to all who know the
country, the best possible guarantee of the authenticity of what they
advance; and I subjoin here a list of the chief works I have either
studied myself or referred to, through the medium of kind helpers in
Tirol, so as not to weary the reader as well as myself with references
in every chapter:&mdash;</p>

<p>I hope my little maps will convey a sufficient notion of the
divisions of Tirol, the position of its valleys and of the routes
through them tracked in the following pages. I have been desirous to
crowd them as little as possible, and to indicate as far as may be, by
the size and direction of the words, the direction and the relative
importance of the valleys.</p>
<p>Of its four divisions the present volume is concerned with the first
(Vorarlberg), the fourth (<span lang="de">W&auml;lsch-Tirol</span>),
and with the greater part of the valleys of the second (<span lang=
"de">Nord</span> or <span lang="de">Deutsch-Tirol</span>.) In the
remoter recesses of them all some strange and peculiar dialects linger,
which perhaps hold a mine in store for the philologist. Yet, though the
belief was expressed more than thirty years ago<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e364src" href="#xd21e364" name="xd21e364src">4</a> that they might
serve as a key to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e373" href=
"#xd21e373" name="xd21e373">xv</a>]</span>Etruscan language, I believe
no one has since been at the pains to pursue this most interesting
research. In the hope of inducing some one to enter this field of
enquiry, I will subjoin a list of some few expressions which do not
carry on their face a striking resemblance to either of the main
languages of the country, leaving to the better-informed to make out
whence they come. The two main languages (and these will suffice the
ordinary traveller for all practical purposes), are German in
Vorarlberg and North Tirol, Italian in W&auml;lsch-Tirol, mixed with
occasional patches of German; and in South-Tirol with a considerable
preponderance of these patches. A tendency to bring about the
absorption of the Italian-speaking valleys into Italy has been much
stimulated in modern times, and in the various troubled epochs of the
last five-and-twenty years Garibaldian attacks have been made upon the
frontier line. The population was found stedfast in its loyalty to
Austria, however, and all these attempts were repulsed by the native
sharp-shooters, with little assistance from the regular troops. An
active club and newspaper propagandism is still going on, promoted by
those who would obliterate Austria from the map of Europe. For them,
there exists only German-Tirol and the Trentino. And the Trentino is
now frequently spoken of as a province bordering on, instead of as in
reality, a division of, Tirol. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e376"
href="#xd21e376" name="xd21e376">xvi</a>]</span></p>
<p>Although German is generally spoken throughout Vorarlberg, there is
a mixture of Italian expressions in the language of the people, which
does not occur at all in North-Tirol: as</p>
<ul>
<li><i lang="de">fazanedle</i>, for a handkerchief (Ital. <i lang=
"it">fazzoletto</i>.)</li>
<li><i lang="de">gaude</i>, gladness (Ital. <i lang=

<li><i lang="de">schapel</i>, the hat (peculiar to local costume),

</ul>
<p>The <i>k</i> in many German words is here written with <i>ch</i>;

periods of Venetian rule.</p>

<ul>
<li><i lang="de">baschga&rsquo;</i> (the final <i>n</i>, <i>en</i>,

Italians constantly clip the final letters of their infinitive, as
<i lang="de">anda&rsquo;</i> and <i lang="de">andar&rsquo;</i> for

</ul>
<p>But all this is, I am aware, but a mere turning over of the surface;
my only wish is that some one of stronger capacity will dig deeper. Of
many dialects, too, I have had no opportunity of knowing anything at
all. Here are, however, a few suggestive or strange words from North
and South Tirol:&mdash;</p>
<p>Pill, which occurs in various localities<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e770src" href="#xd21e770" name="xd21e770src">12</a> of both those
provinces to designate a place built on a little hill or knoll, is
identical with an Etruscan word to which Mr. Isaac Taylor gives a
similar significance.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e776src" href=
"#xd21e776" name="xd21e776src">13</a> I do not overlook Weber&rsquo;s
observation that &lsquo;Pill is obviously a corruption of <i lang=
"de">B&uuml;chel</i> (the German for <span class="corr" id="xd21e784"
title="Source: a a">a</span> knoll), through <i lang=
"de">B&uuml;hel</i> and <i lang="de">B&uuml;hl</i>;&rsquo; but, which
proceeds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e794" href="#xd21e794" name=
"xd21e794">xix</a>]</span>from which is often a knotty point in
questions of derivation, and Weber did not know of the Etruscan
&lsquo;pil.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i lang="de">Ziller</i> and <i lang="de">celer</i> I have already
alluded to,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e803src" href="#xd21e803" name=
"xd21e803src">14</a> though of course it may be said that the Tirolean
river had its name from an already romanised Etruscan word, and does
not necessarily involve direct contact with the Etruscan
vocabulary.</p>
<ul>
<li><i lang="de">Grau-wutzl</i> is a name in the Zillerthal for the
Devil.</li>
<li><i lang="de">Disel</i>, for disease of any kind.</li>
<li><i lang="de">Gigl</i>, a sheep.</li>
<li><i lang="de">Kiess</i>, a heifer.</li>
<li><i lang="de">Triel</i>, a lip.</li>
<li><i lang="de">Bueg</i>, a leg.</li>
<li><i lang="de">knospen</i> stands in South-Tirol for wooden shoes,
and</li>
<li><i lang="de">fokazie</i> for cakes used at Eastertide. (<i lang=
"it">Focaccia</i> is used for &lsquo;cake&rsquo; in many parts of
Italy, and &lsquo;dar pan per focaccia&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;tit for tat&rsquo; all over the Peninsula.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It remains only to excuse myself for the spelling of the word Tirol.
I have no wish to incur the charge of &lsquo;pedantry&rsquo; which has
heretofore been laid on me for so writing it. It seems to me that, in
the absence of any glaring mis-derivation, it is most natural to adopt
a country&rsquo;s own nomenclature; and in Tirol, or by Tirolean
writers, I have never seen the name spelt with a <i>y</i>. I have not
been able to get nearer its derivation than that the Castle above
Meran, which gave it to the whole principality, was called by the
Romans, when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e848" href="#xd21e848"
name="xd21e848">xx</a>]</span>they rebuilt it, Teriolis. Why they
called it so, or what it was called before, I have not been able to
learn. The English use of the definite article in naming Tirol is more
difficult to account for than the adoption of the <i>y</i>, in which we
seem to have been misled by the Germans. We do not say
&lsquo;<i>the</i> France&rsquo; or &lsquo;<i>the</i> Italy;&rsquo; even
to accommodate ourselves to the genius of the languages of those
countries, therefore, that we should have gone out of our way to say
&lsquo;<i>the</i> Tyrol&rsquo; when the genius of that country&rsquo;s
language does <i>not</i> require us so to call it, can have arisen only
from a piece of carelessness which there is no need to repeat.

<p class="first">&lsquo;Traditions, myths, legends! what is the use of
recording and propagating the follies and superstitions of a bygone
period, which it is the boast of our modern enlightenment to have cast
to the winds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such is the hasty exclamation which allusion to these fantastic
matters very frequently elicits. With many they find no favour because
they seem to yield no profit; nay, rather to set up a hindrance in the
way of progress and culture. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href=
"#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>Yet, on the other hand, in spite of their seeming foolishness, they
have worked themselves into favour with very various classes of readers
and students. There is an audacity in their imagery which no mere
sensation-writer could attempt without falling Phaeton-like from his
height; and they plunge us so hardily into a world of their own, so
preposterous and so unlike ours, while all the time describing it in a
language we can understand without effort, that no one who seeks
occasional relief from modern monotony but must experience refreshment
in the weird excursions their jaunty will-o&rsquo;the-wisp dance leads
him. But more than this; their sportive fancy has not only charmed the
dilettante; they have revealed that they hold inherent in them
mysteries which have extorted the study of deep and able thinkers, one
of whom<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1235src" href="#xd21e1235" name=
"xd21e1235src">1</a> insisted, now some years ago, that &lsquo;by this
time the study of popular tales has become a recognized branch of the
studies of mankind;&rsquo; while important and erudite treatises from
his own pen and that of others<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1241src"
href="#xd21e1241" name="xd21e1241src">2</a> have elevated it further
from a study to a science.</p>
<p>All who love poetry and art, as well as all who are interested in
the study of languages or races, all who have any care concerning the
stirrings of the human mind in its search after the supernatural and
the infinite, must confess to standing largely in debt, in the absence
of more positive records of the earliest phases of thought, to these
various mythologies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3"
name="pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>Karl Blind, in a recent paper on &lsquo;German
Mythology,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1249src" href="#xd21e1249"
name="xd21e1249src">3</a> draws attention to some interesting
considerations why the Germanic traditions, which we chiefly meet with
in Tirol, should have a fascination for us in this country, in the
points of contact they present with our language and customs. Not
content with reckoning that &lsquo;in the words of the Rev. Isaac
Taylor we have obtruded on our notice the names of the deities who were
worshipped by the Germanic races&rsquo; on every Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday of our lives, as we all know, he would even find
the origin of &lsquo;Saturday&rsquo; in the name of <a id="xd21e1255"
name="xd21e1255"></a>a god &ldquo;S&aelig;tere&rdquo; hidden, (a
malicious deity whose name is but an <i>alias</i> for Loki,) of whom,
it is recorded, that once at a great banquet he so insulted all the
heavenly rulers that they chained him, Prometheus-like, to a rock, and
made a serpent trickle down its venom upon his face. His faithful wife
Sigyn held a cup over him to prevent the venom reaching his face, but
whenever she turned away to empty the cup his convulsive pains were
such that the earth shook and trembled.... Few people now-a-days, when
pronouncing the simple word &ldquo;Saturday,&rdquo; think or know of
this weird and pathetic myth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1260src" href=
"#xd21e1260" name="xd21e1260src">4</a>... When we go to Athens we
easily think of the Greek goddess Athene, when we go to Rome we are
reminded of Romulus its mythic founder. But <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>when we go
to Dewerstone in Devonshire, to Dewsbury in Yorkshire, to Tewesley in
Surrey, to Great Tew in Oxfordshire, to Tewen in
Herefordshire&mdash;have a great many of us even an inkling that these
are places once sacred to Tiu, the Saxon Mars? When we got to
Wednesbury, to Wanborough, to Woodnesborough, to Wembury, to Wanstrow,
to Wanslike, to Woden Hill, we visit localities where the Great Spirit
Wodan was once worshipped. So also we meet with the name of the God of
Thunder in Thudersfield, Thundersleigh, Thursleigh, Thurscross,
Thursby, and Thurso. The German Venus Freia is traceable in
Fridaythorpe and Frathorpe, in Fraisthorpe and Freasley. Her son was
Baldur, also called Phol or Pol, the sweet god of peace and light; his
name comes out at Balderby, Balderton, Polbrook, Polstead and Polsden.
S&aelig;tere is probably hidden in Satterleigh and Satterthwaite;
Ostara or Eostre, the Easter goddess of Spring, appears in two Essex
parishes, Good Easter and High Easter, in Easterford, Easterlake and
Eastermear. Again Hel, the gloomy mistress of the underworld, has given
her name to Hellifield, Hellathyrne, Helwith, Healeys and
Helagh&mdash;all places in Yorkshire, where people seem to have had a
particular fancy for that dark and grimy deity. Then we have Asgardby
and Aysgarth, places reminding us of Asgard, the celestial garden or
castle of the &AElig;sir&mdash;the Germanic Olympus. And these
instances might be multiplied by the hundred, so full is England to
this day of the vestiges of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href=
"#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>Germanic mythology. Far more important
is the fact that in this country, just as in Germany, we find current
folk-lore; and quaint customs and superstitious beliefs affecting the
daily life, which are remnants of the ancient creed. A rime apparently
so bereft of sense as</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home!</p>
<p class="line">Thy house is on fire!</p>
<p class="line">Thy children at home!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">can be proved to refer to a belief of our forefathers
in the coming downfall of the universe by a great conflagration. The
ladybird has its name from having been sacred to our Lady Freia. The
words addressed to the insect were once an incantation&mdash;an appeal
to the goddess for the protection of the soul of the unborn, over whom
in her heavenly abode she was supposed to keep watch and ward, and whom
she is asked to shield from the fire that consumes the world.... If we
ever wean men from the crude notions that haunt them, and yet promote
the enjoyment of fancies which serve as embellishing garlands for the
rude realities of life, we cannot do better than promote a fuller
scientific knowledge of that circle of ideas in which those moved who
moulded our very speech. We feel delight in the conceptions of the
Greek Olympus. Painters and poets still go back to that old fountain of
fancy. Why should we not seek for similar delight in studying the
figures of the Germanic Pantheon, and the rich folk-lore connected with
them? Why should that powerful Bible of the Norse religion, which
contains such a wealth of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href=
"#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>striking ideas and descriptions in
language the most picturesque, not be as much perused as the Iliad, the
Odyssey, or the &AElig;neid? Is it too much to say that many even of
those who know of the Koran, of the precepts of Kou-fu-tsi and of
Buddha, of the Zendavesta and the Vedas, have but the dimmest notion of
that grand Germanic Scripture?...</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can it be said that there is a lack of poetical conception in
the figure of Wodan or Odin, the hoary ruler of the winds and the
clouds, who, clad in a flowing mantle, careers through the sky on a
milk-white horse, from whose nostrils fire issues, and who is followed
at night by a retinue of heroic warriors whom he leads into the golden
shield-adorned Walhalla? Is there a want of artistic delineation in
Freia&mdash;an Aphrodite and Venus combined, who changes darkness into
light wherever she appears&mdash;the goddess with the streaming golden
locks and siren voice, who hovers in her sun-white robe between heaven
and earth, making flowers sprout along her path and planting
irresistible longings in the hearts of men? Do we not see in bold and
well-marked outline the figure of the red-bearded, steel-handed Thor,
who rolls along the sky in his goat-drawn car, and who smites the
mountain giants with his magic hammer? Are these mere spectres without
distinct contour?... are they not, even in their uncouth passions, the
representatives of a primitive race, in which the pulse throbs with
youthful freshness? Or need I allude to that fantastic theory of minor
deities, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>of fairies and wood-women, and elfin and pixies and
cobolds, that have been evolved out of all the forces of Nature by the
Teutonic mind, and before whose bustling crowd even Hellenic
imagination pales?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what a dramatic power has the Germanic mythology! The
gods of classic antiquity have been compared to so many statues ranged
along a stately edifice ... in the Germanic view all is active
struggle, dramatic contest, with a deep dark background of inevitable
fate that controls alike gods and men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such are the Beings whom we meet wandering all over Tirol;
transformed often into new personalities, invested with new attributes
and supplemented with many a mysterious companion, the offspring of an
imagination informed by another order of thought, but all of them more
living, and more readily to be met with, than in any part of
wonder-loving Germany itself.</p>
<p>Apart from their mythological value, how large is the debt we owe to
legends and traditions in building up our very civilization. Their
influence on art is apparent, from the earliest sculptured stones
unearthed in India or Etruria to the latest breathing of symbolism in
the very reproductions of our own day. In poetry, no less a master than
Dante lamented that their influence was waning at the very period
ascribed a few years ago as the date of their taking rise. Extolling
the simpler pursuits and pleasures of his people at a more primitive
date than his own, &lsquo;One by the crib kept watch,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;studious to still the infant plaint <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>with words
which erst the parents&rsquo; minds diverted; another, the flaxen maze
upon the distaff twirling, recounted to her household, tales of Troy,
Fiesole, and Rome.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1295src" href=
"#xd21e1295" name="xd21e1295src">5</a> Their work is patent in his own
undying pages, and in those of all true poets before and since.</p>
<p>Besides all this, have they not preserved to us, as in a registering
mirror, the manners and habits of thought of the ages preceding ours?
Have they not served to record as well as to mould the noblest
aspirations of those who have gone before? &lsquo;What are they,&rsquo;
asks an elegant Italian writer of the present day,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1324src" href="#xd21e1324" name="xd21e1324src">6</a> treating,
however, only of the traditions of the earliest epoch of Christianity,
&lsquo;but narratives woven beside the chimney, under the tent, during
the halt of the caravan, embodying as in a lively picture the popular
customs of the apostolic ages, the interior life of the rising
(<i>nascente</i>) Christian society? In them we have a delightful
opportunity of seeing stereotyped the great transformation and the rich
source of ideas and sentiments which the new belief opened up, to
illuminate the common people in their huts no less than the patricians
in their palaces. Those even who do not please <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>to believe
the facts they expose are afforded a genuine view of the habits of
life, the manner of speaking and behaving&mdash;all that expresses and
paints the erudition of those men and of those times. Thus, it may be
affirmed, they comment beautifully on the Gospels, and in the midst of
fables is grafted a great abundance of truth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If we would investigate the cause of their multiplication,
and of the favour with which they were received from the earliest
times, we shall find it to consist chiefly in the need and love of the
marvellous which governed the new society, notwithstanding the severity
of its dogmas. Neophytes snatched from the superstitions of paganism
would not have been able all at once to suppress every inclination for
poetical fables. They needed another food according to their fancy. And
indeed were they not great marvels (though of another order from those
to which they were accustomed) which were narrated to them? The
aggregate mass was, however, increased by the way in which they lived
and the scarcity of communication; every uncertain rumour was thus
readily dressed up in the form of a wonderful fact.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Again, dogmatic and historical teaching continued long to be
oral; so that when an apostle, or the apostle of an apostle, arrived in
any city and chained the interest of the faithful with a narration of
the acts of Jesus he had himself witnessed or received from the
personal narrative of witnesses, his words ran along from mouth
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>to mouth, and each repeater added something,
suggested by his faith or by his heart. In this way his teaching
constituted itself into a legend, which in the end was no longer the
narrative of one, but the expression of the faith of all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus whoever looks at legends only as isolated productions of
a period most worthy of study, without attending to the influence they
exercised on later epochs, must even so hold them in account as
literary monuments of great moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nor is this the case only with the earliest legends. The popular
mind in all ages has evinced a necessity for filling up all blanks in
the histories of its heroes. The probable, and even the merely
possible, is idealized; what <i>might have been</i> is reckoned <i>to
have</i> happened; the logical deductions as to what a favourite saint
or cobbold <i>ought to</i> have done, according to certain fixed
principles of action previously ascribed to his nature, are taken to be
the very acts he did perform; and thus, even those traditions which are
the most transparently human in their origin, have served to show
reflected in action the virtues and perfections which it is the boast
of religion to inculcate.</p>
<p>A Flemish writer on Spanish traditions similarly remarks,
&lsquo;Peoples who are cut off from the rest of the world by such
boundaries as seas, mountains, or wastes, by reason of the difficulty
of communication thus occasioned, are driven to concentrate their
attention to local events; and in their many idle hours they work up
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>myths and tales into poems, which stand them in
stead of books, and, in fact, constitute a literature.&rsquo;<a class=

</div>
<p>Europe possesses in Tirol one little country at least in whose
mountain fastnesses a store of these treasures not only lies enshrined,
but where we may yet see it in request. Primitive and unsophisticated
tillers of the soil, accustomed to watch as a yearly miracle the
welling up of its fruits, and to depend for their hopes of subsistence
on the sun and rain in the hand of their Creator, its children have not
yet acquired the independence of thought and the habit of referring all
events to natural causes, which is generated by those industries of
production to which the human agent appears to be all in all. Among
them we have the opportunity of seeing these expositions of the
supernatural, at home as it were in their contemporary life, supplying
a representation of what has gone before, only to be compared to the
revelations of deep-cut strata to the geologist, and the unearthing of
buried cities to the student of history. It is further satisfactory to
find that, in spite of our repugnance to superstition, this unreasoning
realization of the supernatural has in no way deteriorated the people.
Their public virtues, seen in their indomitable devotion to their
country, have been conspicuous in all ages, no less than their heroic
labours in grappling with the obstacles of soil and climate; while all
who have visited them concur in bearing testimony to their possession
of sterling homely qualities, frugality, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>morality, hospitality;
and, for that which is of most importance to the tourist, all who have
been among them will bear witness to the justice of the remark in the
latest Guide-book, that, except just in the more cultivated centres of
Innsbruck, Brixen, and Botzen, you need take no thought among the
Tiroleans concerning the calls on your purse.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>My first acquaintance with Tirol was made at Feldkirch, where I had
to pay somewhat dearly for my love of the legendary and the primitive.
Our plan for the autumn was to join a party of friends from Italy at
Innsbruck, spend some months of long-promised enjoyment in exploring
Tirol, and return together to winter in Rome. The arrangements of the
journey had been left to me; and as I delight in getting beyond
railways and travelling in a conveyance whose pace and hours are more
under one&rsquo;s own control, I traced our road through France to
B&acirc;le, and then by way of Zurich and Rorschach and Oberriet to
Feldkirch (which I knew to be a post-station) as a base of operations,
for leisurely threading our mountain way through Bludenz and Landeck
and the intervening valleys to Innsbruck.</p>
<p>How our plan was thwarted<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1380src" href=
"#xd21e1380" name="xd21e1380src">8</a> I will relate presently. I still
recommend this line of route to others less encumbered with luggage, as
leading through out-of-the-way <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13"
href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>and unfrequented places. The
projected railway between Feldkirch and Innsbruck is now completed as
far as Bludenz; and Feldkirch is reached direct by the new junction
with the Rorschach-Chur railway at Buchsstation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1385src" href="#xd21e1385" name="xd21e1385src">9</a></p>
<p>Feldkirch affords excursions, accessible for all, to the
Margarethenkapf and the St. Veitskapf, from either of which a glorious
view is to be enjoyed. The latter commands the stern gorges through
which the Ill makes its final struggles before losing its identity in
the Rhine&mdash;struggles which are often terrific and devastating, for
every few years it carries down a whole torrent of pebbles for many
days together. The former overlooks the more smiling tracts we
traversed in our forced march, locally called the Ardetzen, hemmed in
by noble mountain peaks. Then its fortifications, intended at one time
to make it a strong border town against Switzerland, have left some few
picturesque remains, and in particular the so-called Katzenthurm, named
from certain clumsy weapons styled &lsquo;cat&rsquo;s head guns,&rsquo;
which once defended it, and which were ultimately melted down to make a
chime of peaceful bells. And then it has two or three churches to which
peculiar legends attach. Not the least curious of these is that of St.
Fidelis, a local saint, whose cultus sprang up as late as the year
1622, when he was laid in wait for and assassinated by certain
fanatical reprobates, whose consciences his earnest preaching had
disturbed. He was declared a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>martyr, and canonized at Rome in
1746. The sword with which he was put to death, the bier on which his
body was carried back into the town, and other things belonging to him,
are venerated as relics. About eight miles outside the town another
saint is venerated with a precisely similar history, but dating from
the year 844. This is St. Eusebius, one of a band of Scotch
missionaries, who founded a monastery there called Victorsberg, the
oldest foundation in all Vorarlberg. St. Eusebius, returning from a
pilgrimage one day, lay down to sleep in this neighbourhood, being
overtaken by the darkness of night. Heathen peasants, who had resisted
his attempts at converting them, going out early in the morning to mow,
found him lying on the ground, and one of them cut off his head with
his scythe. To their astonishment the decapitated body rose to its
feet, and, taking up the head in its hands, walked straight to the door
of the monastery, where the brethren took it in and laid it to rest in
the churchyard. A little further (reached most conveniently by a
by-path off the road near Altenstadt, mentioned below,) is Rankweil. In
the church on Our Lady&rsquo;s Mount (Frauenberg) is a little chapel on
the north side, where a reddish stone is preserved (<i lang="de">Der
rothe Stein in der Fridolinskapelle</i>), of which the following story
is told. St. Fridolin was a Scotch missionary in the seventh century,
and among other religious houses had founded one at M&uuml;sigen. Two
noblemen of this neighbourhood (brothers) held him in great respect,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>before dying, one of them, Ursus by name, endowed
the convent with all his worldly goods. Sandolf, the other, who did not
carry his admiration of the saint to so great a length as to renounce
his brother&rsquo;s rich inheritance, disputed the possession, and it
was decided that Fridolin must give it up unless he could produce the
testimony of the donor. Fridolin went in faith to Glarus, where Ursus
had been buried two years before. At his call the dead man rose to his
feet, and pushing the grave-stone aside, walked, hand-in-hand, with his
friend back to Rankweil, where he not only substantiated
Fridolin&rsquo;s statements, but so effectually frightened his brother
that he immediately added to the gift all his own possessions also. But
the story says that when the judgment requiring him to produce the
testimony of the dead was first given, Fridolin went to pray in the
chapel of Rankweil, and there a shining being appeared to him, and told
him to go to Glarus and call Ursus; and as he spoke Fridolin&rsquo;s
knees sank into the &lsquo;red stone,&rsquo; making the marks now
seen.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1397src" href="#xd21e1397" name=
"xd21e1397src">10</a></p>
<p>The reason given why this hill is called Our Lady&rsquo;s Mound is,
that on it once stood a fortress called Sch&ouml;nberg. Sch&ouml;nberg
having been burnt down, its owner, the knight of H&ouml;rnlingen, set
about rebuilding it; but whatever work his workmen did in the day-time,
was destroyed by invisible hands during the night. A pious old workman,
too, used to hear a mysterious voice saying <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>that
instead of a fortress they should build a sanctuary in honour of the
mother of God. The knight yielded to the commands of the voice, and the
church was built out of the ruins of his castle. In this church, too,
is preserved a singular antique cross, studded with coloured glass
gems, which the people venerate because it was brought down to them by
the mountain stream. It is obviously of very ancient workmanship, and
an inscription records that it was <i>repaired</i> in 1347.</p>
<p>Winding round the mountain path which from Rankweil runs behind
Feldkirch to Satteins, the convent of Valduna is reached; and the
origin of this sanctuary is ascribed to a legend, of which counterparts
crop up in various places, of a hermit who passed half a life within a
hollow tree,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1412src" href="#xd21e1412"
name="xd21e1412src">11</a> and acquired the lasting veneration of the
neighbouring people.</p>
<p>Another mountain sanctuary which received its veneration from the
memory of a tree-hermit, is S. Gerold, situated on a little elevation
below the Hoch Gerach, about seven miles on the east side of Feldkirch.
It dates from the tenth century. Count Otho, Lord of Sax in the
Rhinethal, was out hunting, when the bear to which he was giving chase
sought refuge at the foot of an old oak tree, whither his dogs durst
not follow it. Living as a hermit within this oak tree Count Otho found
his long lost father, S. Gerold, who years before had forsaken his
throne and found there a life of contemplation in the wild.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1417src" href="#xd21e1417" name=
"xd21e1417src">12</a> The tomb of the saint and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>his two
sons is to be seen in the church, and some curious frescoes with the
story of his adventures.</p>
<p>Another way to be recommended for entering Vorarlberg is by crossing
Lake Constance from Rorschach to Lindau, a very pleasant trajet of
about two hours in the tolerably well-appointed, but not very swift
lake-steamers. Lindau itself is a charming old place, formed out of
three islands on the edge of the lake; but as it is outside the border
of Tirol, I will only note in favour of the honesty of its inhabitants,
that I saw a tree laden with remarkably fine ripe pears overhanging a
wall in the principal street, and no street-boy raised a hand to
them.</p>
<p>The first town in Tirol by this route is Bregenz, which reckons as
the capital of Vorarlberg. It may be reached by boat in less than half
an hour. It is well situated at the foot of the Gebhartsberg, which
affords a most delightful, and in Tirol widely celebrated, view over
Lake Constance and the Appenzel mountains and the rapid Rhine between;
and here, at either the Post Hotel or the Black Eagle, there is no lack
of carriages for reaching Feldkirch. Bregenz deserves to be remembered
as the birth-place of one of the best modern painters of the
Munich-Roman school, Flatz, who I believe, spends much of his time
there.</p>
<p>Among the objects of interest in Bregenz are the Capuchin Convent,
situated on a wooded peak of the Gebhardsberg, founded in 1636; on
another peak, S. Gebhard auf dem Pfannenberge, called after a bishop
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>of Constance, who preached the Christian faith in
the neighbourhood, and was martyred. Bregenz has an ancient history and
high lineage. Its lords, who were powerful throughout the Middle Ages,
were of sufficiently high estate at the time of Charlemagne that he
should take Hildegard, the daughter of one of them, to be his wife, and
there is a highly poetical popular tale about her. Taland (a favourite
name in Vorarlberg) was a suitor who had, with jealous eye, seen her
given to the powerful Emperor, and in the bitterness of his rejected
affection, so calumniated her to Charlemagne, that he repudiated her
and married Desiderata, the Lombard princess.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1430src" href="#xd21e1430" name="xd21e1430src">13</a> Hildegard
accepted her trial with angelic resignation, and devoted her life to
tending pilgrims at Rome. Meantime Taland, stricken with blindness,
came to Rome in penitential pilgrimage, where he fell under the
charitable care of Hildegard. Hildegard&rsquo;s saintly handling
restored his sight&mdash;not only that of his bodily eyes, but also his
moral perception of truth and falsehood. In reparation for the evil he
had done, he now led her back to Charlemagne, confessed all, and she
was once more restored to favour and honour. Bregenz has also another
analogous and equally beautiful legend. One of its later counts, Ulrich
V., was supposed by his people to have died in war in Hungary, about
the year 916. Wendelgard, his wife, devoted her widowhood to the
cloistral life, but took the veil under the condition that she should
every <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>year hold a popular festival and distribution of
alms in memory of her husband. On the fourth anniversary, as she was
distributing her bounty, a pilgrim came forward who allowed himself the
liberty of kissing the hand which bestowed the dole. Wendelgard&rsquo;s
indignation was changed into delight when she recognized that the
audaciously gallant pilgrim was no other than her own lord, who, having
succeeded in delivering himself from captivity, had elected to make
himself thus known to her. Salomo, Bishop of Constance, dispensed her
from her vow, and Ulrich passed the remainder of his life at Bregenz by
her side. Another celebrated worthy of Bregenz, whose name must not be
passed over, is &lsquo;Ehreguota&rsquo; or &lsquo;Ehre Guta,&rsquo; a
name still dear to every peasant of Vorarlberg, and which has
perpetuated itself in the appellation of Hergotha, a favourite
Christian name there to the present day. She was a poor beggar-woman
really named Guta, whose sagacity and courage delivered her country
people from an attack of the Appenzell folk, to which they had nearly
succumbed in the year 1408; it was the &lsquo;honour&rsquo; paid her by
her patriotic friends that added the byname of &lsquo;Ehre,&rsquo; and
made them erect a monument to her. One of the variants of the story
makes her, instead of a beggar-woman, the beautiful young bride of
Count Wilhelm of Montfort-Bregenz; some have further sought to identify
her with the goddess Epona.</p>
<p>Pursuing the journey southwards towards Feldkirch, every step is
full of natural beauty and legendary <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>interest. At first
leaving Bregenz you have to part company with Lake Constance, and leave
in the right hand distance the ruins of Castle Fussach. On the left is
Riedenberg, which, if not great architecturally, is interesting as a
highly useful institution, under the fostering care of the present
Empress of Austria, for the education of girls belonging to families of
a superior class with restricted means. From Fussach the road runs
parallel to the Rhine; there is a shorter road by Dornbirn, but less
interesting, which joins it again at G&ouml;tzis, near Hohenembs. The
two roads separate before Fussach at Wolfurth, where there is an
interesting chapel, the bourne of a pilgrimage worth making if only for
the view over the lake. The country between S. John H&ouml;chst and
Lustenau is much frequented in autumn for the sake of the shooting
afforded by the wild birds which haunt its secluded recesses on the
banks of the Rhine at that season. At Lustenau there is a ferry over
the Rhine.</p>
<p>The favourite saints of this part of the country are Merboth, Diedo,
and Ilga&mdash;two brothers and a sister of a noble family,
hermit-apostles and martyrs of the eleventh century. Ilga established
her hermit-cell in the Schwarzenberg, just over Dornbirn, where not
only all dainty food, but even water, was wanting. The people of
Dornbirn also wanted water; and though she had not asked the boon for
herself, she asked it for her people, and obtained from the hard rock,
a miraculous spring of sparkling water which even the winter cold
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>could not freeze. Ilga used to fetch this water
for her own use, and carry it up the mountain paths <i>in her
apron</i>. One day she spilt some of it on the rock near her cell on
her arrival, and see! as it touched the rock, the rock responded to the
appeal, and from out there flowed a corresponding stream, which has
never ceased to flow to this day.</p>
<p>The most important and interesting spot between Bregenz and
Feldkirch, is Embs or Hohenembs, with its grand situation, its
picturesque buildings and its two ruined castles, which though
distinguished as Alt and Neu Hohenembs, do not display at first sight
any very great disparity of age; both repay a visit, but the view from
Alt Hohenembs is the finer. The virtues and bravery of the lords of
Hohenembs have been duly chronicled. James Von Embs served by the side
of the chevalier Bayard in the battle of Ravenna, and having at the
first onset received his death wound, raised himself up again to pour
out his last breath in crying to his men, &lsquo;The King of France has
been our fair ally, let us serve him bravely this day!&rsquo; His
grandson, who was curiously enough christened James Hannibal, was the
first Count of Embs, and his descendants often figure in records of the
wars of the Austrian Empire, particularly in those connected with the
famous Schmalkaldischer Krieg, and are now merged in the family of
Count Harrach.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Swiss embroidery&rsquo; industry here crosses the Rhine,
and, in the female gatherings which it occasions, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>as in
the &lsquo;Filo&rsquo; of the south, many local chronicles and legends
are, or at least have been, perpetuated.</p>
<p>In the parish church, I have been told by a traveller, that the
cardinal&rsquo;s hat of S. Charles Borromeo is preserved, though why it
should be so I cannot tell; and I think I have myself had it shown me
both at Milan and, if I mistake not, also at the church in Rome whence
he had his &lsquo;title.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ascent to Neu Hohenembs has sufficient difficulty and danger for
the unpractised pedestrian to give it special interest, which the
roaring of the waterfall tends to excite. A little way beyond it the
water was formerly turned to the purpose of an Italian <i lang=
"it">pescheria</i> (or fish-preserve for the use of the castle), which
is not now very well preserved. Further up still are the ruins of Alt
Hohenembs. There are also prettily situated sulphur baths a little way
out of the town, much frequented from June to September by the country
people. It is curious that the Jews, who have never hitherto settled in
large numbers in any part of Tirol, have here a synagogue; and I am
told that it serves for nearly a hundred families scattered over the
surrounding country, though there are not a dozen even at
Innsbruck.</p>
<p>All I have met with of interest between this and Feldkirch, I have
mentioned under the head of excursions from Feldkirch.</p>
<p>Stretching along the bank of the Rhine to the south of Feldkirch, is
the little principality of Lichtenstein <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>or Liechtenstein, a
territory of some three square miles and a half in extent, which yet
gives its possessor&mdash;lately by marriage made a member of English
society&mdash;certain seignorial rights. The chief industry of the
people is the Swiss embroidery. Vaduz, its chief town, is situated in
its centre, and above it, in the midst of a thick wood, is the somewhat
imposing and well kept up castle of Lichtenstein. Further south,
overhanging the Rhine, is Schloss Gutenberg, and beyond, a remarkable
warm sulphur spring, which runs only in summer, at a temperature of
98&deg; to 100&deg; Fahrenheit; it is crowded by Swiss and Tiroleans
from June to September, though unknown to the rest of the
world.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1466src" href="#xd21e1466" name=
"xd21e1466src">14</a> It was discovered in the year 1240 by a
chamois-hunter, and was soon after taken in charge by a colony of
Benedictine monks, established close by at Pf&auml;ffers, who continued
to entertain those who visited it until it was taken possession of by
the Communal Council of Chur, and the monastery turned into a
poor-house. The country round it is exceedingly wild and romantic, and
there is a celebrated ravine called the Tamina-Schlund, of so-called
immeasurable depth, where at certain hours of a sunny day a wonderful
play of light is to be observed. Pf&auml;ffers is just outside the
boundary of Tirol; the actual boundary line is formed by the
Rh&aelig;tian Alps, which are traversed by a pass called Luziensteig,
after St. Lucius, &lsquo;first Christian king of Britain,&rsquo; who,
tradition says, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>preached the gospel to Lichtenstein.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1471src" href="#xd21e1471" name=
"xd21e1471src">15</a> The road from Feldkirch to Innsbruck first runs
along the Illthal, which between Feldkirch and Bludenz is also called
the Wallgau, and merges at Bludenz into the Walserthal on the left or
north side. On the right or south side are the Montafonthal,
Klosterthal, and Silberthal.</p>
<p>Soon after leaving Feldkirch the mountains narrow upon the road,
which crosses the Ill at Felsenau, forming what is called the gorge of
the Ill, near Frastanz. Round this terrible pass linger memories of one
of the direst struggles for independence the Tiroleans ever waged. In
1499 the Swiss hosts were shown the inlet, through the mountains that
so well protect Tirol, by a treacherous peasant whom their gold had
bought.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1482src" href="#xd21e1482" name=
"xd21e1482src">16</a> A little shepherd lad seeing them advance, in his
burning desire to save his country, blew such a call to arms upon his
horn that he never desisted till he had blown all the breath out of his
little body. The subsequent battle was fierce and determined; and when
it slackened from loss of men, the women rushed in and fought with the
bravest. So earnestly was the cause of those who fell felt to be the
cause of all, that even to the present time the souls of those who were
slain that day are remembered in the prayers said as the procession
nears the spot <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>when blessing the fields on Rogation-Wednesday. On
the heights above Valduna are the striking ruins of a convent of Poor
Clares, one of those abandoned at the fiat of Joseph II. It was founded
on occasion of a hermit declaring he had often seen a beautiful angel
sitting and singing enchantingly on the peak. Below is a tiny lake,
which lends an additional charm to the tranquil beauty of the spot. The
patron saint of the Walserthal is St. Joder or Theodul (local
renderings of Theodoric), and his legend is most fantastic. St. Joder
went to Rome to see the Pope; the Pope, in commendation of his zeal,
gave him a fine bell for his church. Homewards went St. Joder with his
bell, but when he came to the mountains it was more than he could
manage, to drag the bell after him. What did he then do? He bethought
him that he had, by his prayers and exorcisms, conjured the devil out
of the valley where he had preached the faith, so why should not prayer
and exorcism conjure him to carry the bell for the service of his
faithful flock? If St. Joder&rsquo;s faith did not remove mountains it
removed the obstacles they presented, and many a bit of rude carving in
mountain chapels throughout the Walserthal shows a youthful saint, in
rich episcopal vestments, leading by a chain, like a showman his bear,
the arch enemy of souls, crouched and sweating under the weight of the
bell whose holy tones are to sound his own ban.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Bludenz retains some picturesque remnants of its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>old
buildings. It belonged to the Counts of Sonnenberg, and hence it is
said that it is often called by that name; but it is perhaps more
probable that the height above Bludenz was called Sonnenberg, in
contrast with Schattenberg, above Feldkirch, and that its lords derived
their name from it. The story of the fidelity of Bludenz to Friedrich
<i lang="de">mit der leeren Tasche</i>, I have narrated in another
place.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1497src" href="#xd21e1497" name=

<p>The valley of Montafon has for its arms the cross keys of St. Peter,
in memory of a traditionary but anachronistic journey of Pope John
XXIII. to the Council of Constance, in 1414.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1504src" href="#xd21e1504" name="xd21e1504src">19</a> In memory
of the same journey a joy-peal is rung on every Wednesday throughout
the year.</p>
<p>A little way south of Bludenz, down the Montafon valley, is a chapel
on a little height called S. Anton, covering the spot where tradition
says was once a mighty city called Prazalanz, destroyed by an
avalanche. Near here is a tiny stream, of which the peasants tell the
following story:&mdash;They say up the mountain lives a beautiful
maiden, set to guard a treasure, and she can only be released when some
one will thrice kiss a loathsome toad,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1509src" href="#xd21e1509" name="xd21e1509src">20</a> which has
its place on the cover of the treasury, and the maiden feels assured no
one will ever make the venture. She weeps <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>evermore, and they call
this streamlet the &lsquo;Tr&auml;chnab&auml;chle&rsquo;&mdash;the
Tear-rill.</p>
<p>The valley of Montafon is further celebrated for its production of
kirschwasser.</p>
<p>Opposite Dalaas is a striking peak, attaining an elevation of some
5,000 feet, called the Christberg. On the opposite side to Dalaas is a
chapel of St. Agatha; in the days of the silver mining of Tirol, in the
fifteenth century, silver was found in this neighbourhood. On one
occasion a landslip imprisoned a number of miners in their workings. In
terror at their threatened death, they vowed that if help reached them
in time, they would build a chapel on the spot to commemorate their
deliverance. Help did reach them, and they kept their vow. The chapel
is built into the living rock where this occurred, and a grey mark on
the rock is pointed out as a supernatural token which cannot be
effaced, to remind the people of the deliverance that took place there.
It is reached from Dalaas by a terribly steep and rugged path, running
over the Christberg, near the summit of which may be found, by those
whom its hardships do not deter, another chapel, or wayside shrine,
consisting of an image of the Blessed Virgin under a canopy, with an
alcoved seat beneath it for the votary to rest in, called &lsquo;Das
Bruederh&uuml;sle,&rsquo; and this is the reason of its name:&mdash;The
wife of a Count Tanberg gave birth to a dead child; in the fulness of
their faith, the parents mourned that to the soul of their little one
Christian baptism had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href=
"#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>denied, more than the loss of their
offspring. In pursuance of a custom then in vogue in parts of Tirol, if
not elsewhere, the Count sent the body of the infant to be laid on the
altar of St. Joseph, in the parish church, in the hope that at the
intercession of the fosterfather of the Saviour it might revive for a
sufficient interval to receive the sacrament of admission into the
Christian family. The servant, however, instead of carrying his burden
to the church at Schruns (in Montafonthal), finding himself weary by
the time he had climbed up the Christberg, dug a grave, and buried it
instead. The next year there was another infant, also born dead; this
time the Count determined to carry it himself to the church, and by the
time he had toiled to the same spot he too was weary, and sat down to
rest. As he sat he heard a little voice crying from under the ground,
&lsquo;<i lang="de">&auml;tti, n&uuml;m mi&rsquo; &ocirc;
met!</i>&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1527src" href="#xd21e1527"
name="xd21e1527src">21</a> The Count turned up the soil, and found the
body of his last year&rsquo;s infant. Full of joy he carried both
brothers to the altar of St. Joseph, at Schruns; here, continues the
legend, his prayer went up before the divine throne; both infants gave
signs of life before devout witnesses; baptism could be validly
administered, and they, laid to rest in holy ground.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1530src" href="#xd21e1530" name="xd21e1530src">22</a></p>
<p>After Dalaas the road assumes a character of real grandeur, both as
an engineering work and as a study of nature. The size of the telegraph
poles alone (something like fourteen inches in diameter) gives an
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>idea of the sort of storms the road is built to
resist; so do the veritable fortifications, erected here and there, to
protect it from avalanches.</p>
<p>The summit (6,218 ft.) of the Arlberg, whence the province has its
name&mdash;and which in turn is named from Schloss Arlen, the ruins of
which are to be observed from the road&mdash;is marked by a gigantic
crucifix, overhanging the road. An inscription cut in the rock records
that it was opened for traffic (after three hard years of labour) on
St. James&rsquo;s day, 1787; but a considerable stretch of the road now
used was made along a safer and more sheltered pass in 1822&ndash;4,
when a remarkable viaduct called the Franzensbr&uuml;cke was built. Two
posts, striped with the local colours, near the crucifix above-named,
mark the boundary of Vorarlberg and Oberinnthal. As we pass them we
should take leave of Vorarlberg; but it may be convenient to mention in
this place some few of the more salient of the many points of interest
on the onward road to Innsbruck.</p>
<p>The opening of the Stanzerthal, indeed, on which the road is
carried, seems to belong of right to Vorarlberg, for its first
post-halt of S. Christof came into existence through the agency of a
poor foundling boy of that province, who was so moved by the sufferings
of travellers at his date (1386), that he devoted his life to their
service, and by begging collected money to found the nucleus of the
hospice and brotherhood of S. Christof, which lasted till the time of
Joseph II. The pass at its highest part is free from snow <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>only
from the beginning of July to September, and in the depth of winter it
accumulates to a height of twenty feet. The church contains
considerable remains of the date of its founder, <i lang="de">Heinrich
das Findelkind</i>; of this date, or not much later, must be the
gigantic statue of S. Christopher, patron of wayfarers.</p>
<p>The Stanzerthal, without being less grand, presents a much more
smiling prospect than that traversed during the later part of the
journey through Vorarlberg. The waters of the Rosanna and the Trisanna
flow by the way; the mountains stretch away in the distance, in every
hue of brilliant colouring; the whole landscape is studded with
villages clustering round their church steeples, while
Indian-corn-fields, fruit-gardens in which the barberry holds no
insignificant place, and vast patches of a deep-tinted wild flora, fill
up the picture.</p>
<p>At Schloss Wiesburg is the opening into the Patznaunthal, the chief
village of which is Ischgl, where the custom I have heard of in other
parts of Tirol, and also in Brittany, prevails, of preserving the
skulls of the dead in an open vault in the churchyard, with their names
painted on them. Nearly opposite it, off the left side of the road lies
Gr&uuml;ns or Grins, so called because it affords a bright green patch
amid the grey of the rocks. It was a more important place in
medi&aelig;val times, for the road then ran beside it; the bridge with
its pointed arches dates from the year 1639. Margareta Maultasch, with
whose place in Tirolese <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>history we must make acquaintance
further on, had a house here which still contains some curious mural
paintings.</p>
<p>Landeck<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1554src" href="#xd21e1554" name=
"xd21e1554src">23</a> is an important thriving little town, with the
Inn flowing through its midst. It has two fine remains of ancient
castles: Schloss Landeck, now used partly as a hospice; and Schloss
Schrofenstein, of difficult access, haunted by a knight, who gave too
ready ear to the calumnies of a rejected suitor of his wife, and must
wander round its precincts wringing his fettered hands and crying
&lsquo;Woe!&rsquo; On the slope of the hill crowned by Schloss Landeck
stands the parish church. Its first foundation dates from the fifteenth
century, when a Landecker named Henry and his wife Eva, having lost
their two children in a forest, on vowing a church in honour of the
Blessed Virgin, met a bear and a wolf each carrying one of the children
tenderly on its back. It has a double-bulbed tower of much later date,
and it was restored with considerable care a few years back; but many
important parts remain in their original condition, including some
early sculpture. In the churchyard are two important monuments, one
dating from the fifteenth century, of Oswald Y. Schrofenstein; the
other, a little gothic chapel, consecrated on August 22, 1870, in
memory of the Landeck <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32"
name="pb32">32</a>]</span>contingent of the Tirolean sharpshooters, who
assisted in defending the borders of W&auml;lsch-Tirol in
1866.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1559src" href="#xd21e1559" name=
"xd21e1559src">24</a> About two or three miles from Landeck there is a
celebrated waterfall, at a spot called Letz.</p>
<p>Imst was formerly celebrated for its breed of canary-birds, which
its townsmen used to carry all over Europe. The church contains a
votive tablet, put up by some of them on occasion of being saved from
shipwreck in the Mediterranean. It has a good old inn, once a knightly
palace. From Imst the Pitzthal branches southwards; but concerning it I
have not space to enlarge, as the more interesting excursion to
F&uuml;ssen, on the <span class="corr" id="xd21e1564" title=
"Source: Baravian">Bavarian</span> frontier, must not be passed over.
The pleasantest way of making this excursion is to engage a carriage
for the whole distance at <span class="corr" id="xd21e1567" title=
"Source: Ismt">Imst</span>, but a diligence or &lsquo;Eilwagen,&rsquo;
running daily between Innsbruck and F&uuml;ssen, may be met at
Nassereit, some three miles along the Gunglthal. At Nassereit I will
pause a moment to mention a circumstance, bearing on the question of
the formation of legends, which seemed to take considerable hold on the
people, and was narrated to me with a manifest impression of belief in
the supernatural. There was a pilgrimage from a place called Biberwier
to a shrine of the Virgin, at Dormiz, on August 10, 1869. It was to
gain the indulgence of the Vatican Council, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>and the
priest of Biberwier in exhorting his people to treat it entirely as a
matter of penance, and not as a party of pleasure, had made use of a
figure of speech bidding them not to trust themselves to the bark of
worldly pleasure, for, he assured them, it had many holes in it, and
would swamp them instead of bearing them on to the joys of heaven. Four
of the men, however, persisted in disregarding his warning, and in
combining a trip to the Fernsee, one of two romantically situated
mountain lakes overlooked by the ancient castle of Sigmundsburg, on a
promontory running into it and with its Wirthshaus &lsquo;auf dem
Fern&rsquo; forming a favourite though difficult pleasure-excursion.
The weather was treacherous; the boat was swamped in the squall which
ensued, and all four men were drowned. From Nassereit also is generally
made the ascent of the Tschirgants, the peak which has constantly
formed a remarkable feature in the landscape all the way from
Arlberg.</p>
<p>The road to F&uuml;ssen passes by Sigmundsburg, Fernsee and
Biberwier mentioned in the preceding narrative also the beautiful
Blendsee and Mittersee (accessible only to the pedestrian) or rather
the by-paths leading to them. Leermoos is the next place
passed,&mdash;a straggling, inconsiderable hamlet, but affording a
pleasing incident in the landscape, when, after passing it, the steep
road winds back upon it and reveals it again far far below you. It is,
however, quite possible to put up for a night with the accommodation
afforded by the Post inn, and by this means one of the most justly
celebrated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>natural beauties may be enjoyed, in the sunset
effects produced by the lighting up of the Zugspitzwand.</p>
<p>Next is L&auml;hn, whose situation disposes one to believe the
tradition that it has its name from the avalanches (<i lang=
"de">Lawinen</i>, locally contracted into L&auml;hne) by which the
valley is frequently visited, and chiefly from a terrible one, in the
fifteenth century, which destroyed the village, till then called
Mitterwald. A carrier who had been wont to pass that way, struck with
compassion at the desolation of the place, aided in providing the
surviving inhabitants to rebuild their chapel, and tradition fables of
him that they were aided by an angel. The road opens out once more as
we approach Heiterwang; there is also a post-road hence to Ammergau;
here, a small party may put up at the Rossl, for the sake of visiting
the Plansee, the second largest lake of Tirol, on the right (east) of
the road; on the left is the opening of the Lechthal, a difficult
excursion even to the most practised pedestrian. For those who study
convenience the Plansee may be better visited from Reutte.</p>
<p>After Heiterwang the rocks close in again on the road as we pass
through the Ehrenberger Klause, celebrated again and again through the
pages of Tirolese history, from the very earliest times, for heroic
defences; its castle is an important and beautiful ruin; and so the
road proceeds to Reutte, F&uuml;ssen, and the much visited Lustschloss
of Schwangau; but as these are in Bavaria I must not occupy my Tirolese
pages with them, but mention only the Mangtritt, the boundary
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>pass, where a cross stands out boldly against the
sky, in memory of S. Magnus, the apostle of these valleys. The devil,
furious at the success of the saint with his conversion of the heathen
inhabitants, sent a tribe of wild and evil men, says one version of the
legend, a formidable dragon <span class="corr" id="xd21e1586" title=
"Source: acording">according</span> to another, to exterminate him; he
was thus driven to the narrow glen where the fine post-road now runs
between the rocks beside the roaring Lech. Nothing daunted, the saint
sprang across to the opposite rock whither his adversaries, who had no
guardian angels&rsquo; wings to &lsquo;bear them up&rsquo;, durst not
pursue him; it is a curious fact for the comparative mythologist that
the same pass bears also the name of Jusulte (<span lang="la">Saltus
Julii</span>) and the tradition that Julius C&aelig;sar performed a
similar feat here on horseback. Near it is a poor little inn, called
&lsquo;the White House,&rsquo; where local vintages may be tasted.</p>
<p>Reutte has two inns; the <i>Post</i> and <i>Krone</i>, and from it
more excursions may be made than I have space to chronicle. That to
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1600" title=
"Source: Breitenerang">Breitenwang</span> is an easy one; a house here
is pointed out as having been built on the spot where stood a poor hut
which gave shelter in his last moments to Lothair II. &lsquo;the
Saxon&rsquo; overtaken by death on his return journey from the war in
Italy, 1137; what remained of the old materials having been
conscientiously worked into the building, down to the most
insignificant spar; a tablet records the event. The church, a
Benedictine foundation of the twelfth century, was rebuilt in the
seventeenth, and contains many specimens <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>of what Tirolese artists
can do in sculpture, wood-carving, and painting. A quaint chapel in the
churchyard has a representation in stucco of the &lsquo;Dance of
Death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The country between this and the Plansee is called the Achenthal,
fortunately distinguished by local mispronounciation as the Archenthal
from the better known (though not deservingly so) Achenthal, which we
shall visit later. The Ache or Arche affords several water-falls, the
most important of them, the Stuibfall, is nearly a hundred feet in
height, and on a bright evening a beautiful &lsquo;iris&rsquo; may be
seen enthroned in its foam.</p>
<p>At the easternmost extremity of the Plansee, to be reached either by
pleasure boat or mountain path, near the little border custom-house,
the Kaiser-brunnen flows into the lake, so called because its cool
waters once afforded a refreshing drink to Ludwig of Brandenberg, when
out hunting: a crucifix marks the spot. There is also a chapel erected
at the end of the 17th century, in consequence of some local vow,
containing a picture of the &lsquo;<span lang="de">Vierzehn
Nothhelfer</span>;&rsquo; and as the so-called &lsquo;Fourteen Helpers
in Need&rsquo; are a favourite devotion all over North-Tirol I may as
well mention their legend here at our first time of meeting them. The
story is that on the feast of the Invention of the Cross, 1445, a
shepherd-boy named Hermann, serving the Cistercian monks of Langheim
(some thirty miles south of Mayence) was keeping sheep on a farm
belonging to them in Frankenthal not far from W&uuml;rtzburg, when he
heard a child&rsquo;s voice crying to him out of the long <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>grass;
he turned round and saw a beautiful infant with two tapers burning
before it, who disappeared as he approached. On the vigil of S. Peter
in the following year Hermann saw the same vision repeated, only this
time the beautiful infant was surrounded by a court of fourteen other
children, who told him they were the &lsquo;Vierzehn Nothelfer,&rsquo;
and that he was to build a chapel to them. The monks refused to believe
Hermann&rsquo;s story, but the popular mind connected it with a
devotion which was already widespread, and by the year 1448 the
mysteriously ordered chapel was raised, and speedily became a place of
pilgrimage. This chapel has been constantly maintained and enlarged and
has now grown into a considerable church; and the devotion to the
&lsquo;Fourteen Helpers in Need&rsquo; spread over the surrounding
country with the usual rapid spread of a popular devotion.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1614src" href="#xd21e1614" name=
"xd21e1614src">25</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38"
name="pb38">38</a>]</span>The chief remaining points of interest in the
further journey to Innsbruck, taking it up where we diverged from it at
Nassereit, are mentioned later in my excursions for Innsbruck.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>Before closing my chapter on Vorarlberg I must put on record, as a
warning to those who may choose to thread its pleasant valleys, a
laughable incident which cut short my first attempt to penetrate into
Tirol by its means. Our line of route I have already named.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1633src" href="#xd21e1633" name=
"xd21e1633src">26</a> Our start was in the most genial of August
weather; our party not only harmonious, but humorously inclined; all
our stages were full of interest and pleasure, and their memory glances
at me reproachfully as I pass them over in rigid obedience to the duty
of adhering to my programme. But no, I <i>must</i> devote a word of
gratitude to the friendly Swiss people, and their kindly hospitable
manners on all occasions. The pretty bathing establishments on the
lakes, where the little girls go in on their way to school, and swim
about as elegantly as if the water were their natural element; the
wonderful roofs of Aarau; its late-flowering pomegranates; and the
clear delicious water, tumbling along its narrow bed down the centre of
all the streets, where we stop to taste of the crystal brook, using the
hollow of our hands, pilgrim fashion, and the kind people more than
once come out of their houses to offer us glasses and chairs!</p>
<p>I <i>must</i> bestow, too, another line of record on the charming
village of Rorschach, the little colony of Catholics in the midst of a
Protestant canton. Its delicious situation on the Boden-see; our row
over the lake by moonlight, where we are nearly run down by one of the
steamers perpetually crossing it in all <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>directions, while our old
boatman pours out and loses himself in the mazes of his legendary lore;
the strange effect of interlacing moonbeams, interspersed by golden
rays from the sanct lamps with Turner-like effect, seen through the
open grated door of the church; the grotesque draped skeletons
supporting the roof of one of the chapels, Caryatid fashion and the
rustic procession on the early morning of the Assumption.</p>
<p>So far all had gone passing well; my first misgiving arose when I
saw the factotum of the Oberriet station eye our luggage, the provision
of four English winterers in Rome, and a look of embarrassed
astonishment dilate his stolid German countenance. It was evident that
when he engaged himself as ticket-clerk, porter, &lsquo;and
<i>everyting</i>,&rsquo; he never contemplated such a pile of boxes
being ever deposited at his station. We left him wrapt in his earnest
gaze, and walked on to see what help we could get in the village. It
was a collection of a half-dozen cottages, picturesque in their utter
uncivilization, clustered round an inn of some pretensions. The host
had apparently heard of the depth of English purses, and was delighted
to make his <i lang="fr">premi&egrave;res armes</i> in testing their
capacity. Of course there was &lsquo;no arguing with the master
of&rsquo; the only horses to whose assistance we had to look for
carrying us beyond the mountains, which now somehow struck us as much
more plainly marked on the map than we had noticed before. His price
had to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>ours, and his statement of the distance, about
double the reality, had to be accepted also. His stud was soon
displayed before us. Three rather tired greys were brought in from the
field, and made fast (or rather loose) with ropes to a waggon, on which
our formidable <i lang="de">Gep&auml;ck</i> was piled, and took their
start with funeral solemnity. An hour later a parcel of boys had
succeeded in capturing a wild colt destined to assist his venerable
parent in transporting ourselves in a &lsquo;shay,&rsquo; of the Gilpin
type, and to which we managed to hang on with some difficulty, the
wild-looking driver good-naturedly volunteering to run by the side.</p>
<p>Off we started with the inevitable thunder of German whip-cracking
and German imprecations on the cattle, sufficient for the first twenty
paces to astonish the colt into propriety. No sooner had we reached the
village boundary, however, than he seemed to guess for the first time
that he had been entrapped into bondage. With refreshing juvenile
buoyancy he instantly determined to show us his indomitable spirit.
Resisting all efforts of his companion in harness to proceed, he
suddenly made such desperate assault and battery with his hind legs,
that one or two of the ropes were quickly snapped, the Jehu sent
sprawling in the ditch on one side, and the travelling bags on the
other; so that, but for the staid demeanour of the old mare, we should
probably in two minutes more have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42"
href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>been &lsquo;nowhere.&rsquo; Hans
was on his feet again in an instant, like the balanced mannikins of a
bull-fight, and to knot the ropes and make a fresh start required only
a minute more; but another and another exhibition of the colt&rsquo;s
pranks decided us to trust to our own powers of locomotion.</p>
<p>A bare-footed, short-petticoated wench, who astonished us by proving
that her rough hands could earn her livelihood at delicate
&lsquo;Swiss&rsquo; embroidery, and still more by details of the small
remuneration that contented her, volunteered to pilot us through the
woods where we had quite lost our way; and finding our luggage van
waiting on the banks of the Rhine for the return of the ferry, we
crossed with it and walked by its side for the rest of the
distance.</p>
<p>Our road lay right across the Ardetzen, a basin of pasture enclosed
by a magnificent circuit of mountains,&mdash;behind us the distant
eminences of Appenzell, before us the great Rh&aelig;tian Alps, and at
their base a number of smiling villages each with its green spire
scarcely detaching from the verdant slopes behind. The undertaking,
pleasant and bright at first, grew weary and anxious as the sun
descended, and the mountains of Appenzell began to throw their long
shadow over the lowland we were traversing, and yet the end was not
reached. At last the strains of an organ burst upon our ears, lights
from latticed windows diapered our path, and a train of worshippers
poured past us to join in the melodies of the Church, sufficiently
large to argue that our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>stopping-place was attained. We cast
about to find the <i lang="de">Gasthof zur Post</i> to which we were
bound, but all in vain, there was no rest for us.</p>
<p>Here indeed, Feldkirch <i>fuit</i>, but here it was no more. In the
year 909, the Counts of Montfort built themselves a castle on the
neighbouring height of Schattenburg, (so called because the higher
eminences around shade it from the sun till late in the morning,) and
lured away the people from this pristine Feldkirch to settle themselves
round the foot of their fortress. Some of the original inhabitants
still clung to the old place, and its old Church of St. Peter, that
very church whose earlier foundations, some say, were laid by monks
from Britain, S. Columban and St. Gall, who, when the people were
oppressed by their Frankish masters, came and lived among them, and by
their preaching and their prayers rekindled the light of religion,
working out at the same time their political relief; the former
subsequently made his way, shedding blessings as he went, on to Italy,
where he died at the age of ninety, in 615; the latter founded, and
ended his days at the age of ninety-five, in the famous monastery which
has given his name to the neighbouring Swiss Canton.</p>
<p>The descendants of this remnant have kept up the original settlement
to this day with the name of Altenstadt, while the first built street
of the present thriving town of Feldkirch still retains its appellation
of the Neustadt. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span></p>
<p>It seemed a long stretch ere we again came upon an inhabited spot,
but this time there was no mistake. All around were the signs of a
prosperous centre, the causeways correctly laid out, new buildings
rising on every side, and&mdash;I am fain to add&mdash;the church dark
and closed; in place of the train of worshippers of unsophisticated
Altenstadt, one solitary figure in mourning weeds was kneeling in the
moonlight at a desk such as we often see placed under a cross against
the outer wall of churches in Germany.</p>
<p>Before five next morning I was awakened by the pealing organ and
hearty voices of the Feldkirch peasants at Mass in the church just
opposite my window. I dressed hastily, and descended to take my place
among them. It was a village festival and Mass succeeded Mass at each
of the gaily decorated altars, and before them assembled groups in
quaint costumes from far and near.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1686src"
href="#xd21e1686" name="xd21e1686src">27</a> As each half hour struck,
a bell sounded, and a relic was brought round to the high altar rails,
all the women in the church going up first, and then all the men, to
venerate it.</p>
<p>Our first care of the day was to engage our carriage for Innsbruck.
We were at the Post hotel, and had the best chance there; for besides
its own conveyances, there were those of the post-office, which
generally in Germany afford great convenience. Not one was there,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>however, that would undertake our luggage over the
mountain roads. The post-master and his men all declared that at every
winding of the passes there would be too great risk of overturning the
vehicle. It was in vain we argued that the same amount had often
accompanied us over higher mountains in Italy; it was clear they were
not prepared for it. There was a service for heavy goods by which it
could be sent; there was no other way, and they did not advise that.
They could not ensure any due care being taken of it, or that it should
reach within three or four weeks. Four or five hours spent in weighing,
measuring, arranging, and arguing, advanced our cause not a whit; there
was no plan to be adopted but to return by Oberriet to Rorschach, cross
lake Constance to Lindau, and make our way round by Augsburg, Munich,
and Rosenheim!</p>
<p>It was with great reluctance we relinquished the cherished project.
Our now hated luggage deposited in a waggon, as the day before, we
mounted our rather more presentable, and certainly better horsed
vehicle, in no cheerful mood, for, besides the disappointment, there
was the mortification which always attaches to a failed project and
retraced steps.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i lang="de">Herrschaften</i> are not in such bright
spirits as the sun to-day!&rsquo; exclaimed our driver, when, finally
tired of cracking his whip and shouting to his horses, he found we
still sat silent and crest-fallen. He wore the jauntiest costume to be
found in Europe, after that of his Hungarian confr&egrave;re, a short
postilion jacket, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46"
name="pb46">46</a>]</span>bound and trimmed with yellow lace, a horn
slung across his breast by a bright yellow cord, and a hat shining like
looking-glass cocked on one side of his head, while his face expressed
everything that is pleasant and jovial.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can one be anything but out of spirits when one is
crossed by such a stupid set as the people of your town? Why, there is
no part of Europe in which they will even believe it
possible!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you see they <i>don&rsquo;t</i> understand much, about
here,&rsquo; he replied, with an air of superiority, for he was a
travelled postilion, as he took care to let us know. &lsquo;In Italy
they manage better; they tie the luggage on behind, or underneath,
where it is safe enough. Here they have only one idea&mdash;to stick it
on the top, and in that way a carriage may be easily upset at a sharp
turn. You cannot drive any new idea into these fellows; it is like an
echo between their own mountains, whatever is once there, goes on and
on and on.&rsquo; I showed him the map, and traced before him the
difference in the length of the route we should have taken and that we
had now to pursue. I don&rsquo;t think he had ever understood a map
before, for he seemed vastly pleased at the compliment paid to his
intelligence. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;if we could always
go as the crow flies, how quickly we should get to our journey&rsquo;s
end; or if we had the Stase-Sattel, as they used to
have&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t <i>that</i> fine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Stase-Sattel,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;what is
that?&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;What! don&rsquo;t you know about the Stase-Sattel&mdash;at
that place, Bludenz, there,&rsquo; and he pointed to it on the
map,<a id="xd21e1717" name="xd21e1717"></a> &lsquo;where you were
telling me you wanted to have gone, there used to live an old woman
named Stase, and folk said she was a witch. She had a wonderful saddle,
on to which she used to set herself when she wanted anything, and it
used to fly with her ever so high, and quicker than a bird. One day the
reapers were in a field cooking their mess, and they had forgotten to
bring any salt&mdash;and <i>hupf!</i> quick! before the pot had begun
to boil she had flown off on her saddle to the salt-mines at Hall,
beyond Innsbruck, and back with salt enough to pickle an ox. Another
time there was a farmer who had been kind to her, whose crops were
failing for the drought. She no sooner heard of his distress than up
she flew in her saddle and swept all the clouds together with her broom
till there was enough to make a good rainfall. Another time, a boy who
had been sent with a message by his master to the next village had
wasted all the day in playing and drinking with her; towards dusk he
bethought himself that the gates would be shut and the dogs let loose,
so that it was a chance if he reached the house alive. But she told him
not to mind, and taking him up on her saddle, she carried him up
through the air and set him down at home before the sun was an inch
lower.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what became of her?&rsquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Became of her! why, she went the way of all such folk. They

"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>them at
the last. One day she was on one of her wild errands, and it was a
<i lang="de">Fest-tag</i> to boot. Her course took her exactly over a
church spire, and just as she passed, the <i lang="de">Wandlung</i>
bell<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1735src" href="#xd21e1735" name=
"xd21e1735src">28</a> tolled. The sacred sound tormented her so that
she lost her seat and fell headlong to the ground. When they came out
of church they found her lying a shapeless mass upon the stone step of
the churchyard cross. Her enchanted saddle was long kept in the Castle
of Landeck&mdash;maybe it is there yet; and even now when we want to
tell one to go quickly on an errand, we say, &ldquo;Fly on the saddle
of Dame Stase.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have had many such folk about here,&rsquo; I observed
seriously, with the view of drawing him out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes, they tell many such tales,&rsquo; he answered;
&lsquo;and if they&rsquo;re not true, they at least serve to keep alive
the faith that God is over us all, and that the evil one has no more
power than just what He allows. There&rsquo;s another story they tell,
just showing that,&rsquo; he continued. &lsquo;Many years ago there was
a peasant (and he lived near Bludenz too) who had a great desire to
have a fine large farm-house. He worked hard, and put his savings by
prudently; but it wouldn&rsquo;t do, he never could get enough. One
day, in an evil hour, he let his great desire get the better of him,
and he called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>the devil in <i lang=
"de">dreiteufelsnamen</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1755src" href=
"#xd21e1755" name="xd21e1755src">29</a> to his assistance. It was not,
you see, a deliberate wickedness&mdash;it was all in a moment, like.
But the devil came, and didn&rsquo;t give him time to reflect. &ldquo;I
know what you want,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you shall have your house
and your barns and your hen-house, and all complete, this very night,
without costing you a penny; but when you have enjoyed it long enough,
your old worn-out carcass shall belong to me.&rdquo; The good peasant
hesitated; and the devil, finding it necessary to add another bait, ran
on: &ldquo;And what is more, I&rsquo;ll go so far as to say that if
every stone is not complete by the first cock-crow, I&rsquo;ll strike
out even this condition, and you shall have it <i>out and
out</i>.&rdquo; The peasant was dazzled with the prospect, and could
not bring himself all at once to refuse the accomplishment of his
darling hope. The devil shook him by the hand as a way of clenching the
bargain, and disappeared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The peasant went home more alarmed than rejoiced, and full of
fear above all that his wife should inquire the meaning of all the
hammering and blustering and running hither and thither which was to be
heard going on in the homestead, for she was a pious God-fearing
woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He remained dumb to all her inquiries, hour after hour
through the night; but at last, towards morning, his courage failed
him, and he told her all. She, like a good wife, gave back no word of
reproach, but cast <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50"
name="pb50">50</a>]</span>about to find a remedy. First she considered
that he had done the thing thoughtlessly and rashly, and then she
ascertained that at last he had given no actual consent. Finally,
deciding matters were not as bad as might be, she got up, and bid him
leave the issue to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;First she knelt down and commended herself and her
undertaking to God and His holy saints; then in the small hours, when
the devil&rsquo;s work was nearly finished, she took her lamp and
spread out the wick so that it should give its greatest glare, and
poured fresh oil upon it, and went out with a basket of grain to feed
the hens. The cock, seeing the bright light and the good wife with her
basket of food, never doubted but that it was morning, and springing
up, he flapped his wings, and crowed with all his might. At that very
moment the devil himself was coming by with the last
roof-stone.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1769src" href="#xd21e1769" name=
"xd21e1769src">30</a> At the sound of the premature cock-crow he was so
much astonished that he didn&rsquo;t know which way to turn, and sank
into the ground bearing the stone still in his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The house belonged to the peasant by every right, but no
stone could ever be made to stay on the vacant space. This
inconvenience was the penance he had to endure for the desperate game
he had played, and he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51"
name="pb51">51</a>]</span>took it cheerfully, and when the rain came in
he used to kiss his good wife in gratitude for the more terrible
chastisement from which she had saved him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The jaunty postilion whipped the horses on as he thus brought his
story to a close, or rather cracked his whip in the air till the
mountains resounded with it, for he had slackened speed while telling
his tale, and the day was wearing on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must take care and not be late for the train,&rsquo; he
observed. &lsquo;The <i lang="de">Herrschaften</i> have had enough of
the inn of Oberriet, and don&rsquo;t want to have to spend a night
<i>there</i>, and we have no <i lang="de">Vorarlberger-geist</i> to
speed us now-a-days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who was he?&rsquo; I inquired eagerly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose you know that all this country round about here is
called the Vorarlberg, and in olden time there was a spirit that used
to wander about helping travellers all along its roads. When they were
benighted, it used to go before them with a light; when they were in
difficulties, it used to procure them aid; if one lost his way, it used
to direct him aright; till one day a poor priest came by who had been
to administer a distant parishioner. His way had lain now over bog, now
over torrent-beds. In the roughness of the way the priest&rsquo;s horse
had cast a shoe. A long stretch of road lay yet before him, but no
forge was near. Suddenly the <i lang="de">Vorarlberger-geist</i> came
out of a cleft in the rock, silently set to work and shod the horse,
and passed on its way as usual with a sigh. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;<i lang="de">Vergeltsgott!</i>&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1803src" href="#xd21e1803" name=
"xd21e1803src">31</a> cried the priest after it.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd21e1807" title=
"Source: &ldquo;&lsquo;">&lsquo;&ldquo;</span>God be praised!&rdquo;
exclaimed the spirit. &ldquo;Now am I at last set free. These hundred
years have I served mankind thus, and till now no man has performed
this act of gratitude, the condition of my release.&rdquo; And since
this time it has never been seen again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We had now once more reached the banks of the Rhine. The driver of
the luggage van held the ferry in expectation of us, and with its team
it was already stowed on board. Our horses were next embarked, and then
ourselves, as we sat, perched on the carriage. A couple of rough
donkeys, a patriarchal goat, and half-a-dozen wild-looking half-clothed
peasants, made up a freight which seemed to tax the powers of the crazy
barge to the utmost; and as the three brawny ferrymen pulled it
dexterously along the guide rope, the waters of the here broad and
rapid river rose some inches through the chinks. All went well,
however, and in another half-hour we were again astonishing the
factotum of the Oberriet station with a vision of the
&lsquo;<span class="corr" id="xd21e1812" title=

Following are the names of the fourteen, but I have never met any one
who could explain the selection. 1. S. Acatius, bishop in Asia Minor,
saved from death in the persecutions under Decius, 250, by a miracle he
performed in the judgment hall where he was tried, and in memory of
which he carries a tree, or a branch of one, in pictures of him. 2. S.
&AElig;gidius (Giles, in German, Gilgen), Hermit, of Nimes, nourished
in his cell by the milk of a hind, which, being hunted, led to the
discovery of his sanctity, an episode constantly recurring in the
legendary world. Another poetical legend concerning him is that a monk,
having come to him to express a doubt as to the virginity of Our Lady,
S. Giles, for all answer traced her name in the sand with his staff,
and forthwith full-bloom lilies sprang up out of it. 3. S. Barbara. A
maiden whom her heathen father shut up in a tower, that nothing might
distract her attention from the life of study to which he devoted her;
among the learned men who came to enjoy her elevated conversation came
a Christian teacher, and converted her; in token of her belief in the
doctrine of the Trinity she had three windows made in her tower, and by
the token her father discovered her conversion, delivered her to
judgment, and she suffered an incredible repetition of martyrdoms. She
is generally painted with her three-windowed tower in her hand. 4. S.
Blase, Bishop of Sebaste and Martyr, <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 288.
He had studied medicine, and when concealed in the woods during time of
persecution, the wild beasts used to bring the wounded of their number
to his feet to be healed. Men hunting for Christians to drag to
justice, found him surrounded by lions, tigers, and bears; even in
prison he continued to exercise his healing powers, and from restoring
to life a boy who had been suffocated by swallowing a fishbone, he is
invoked as patron against sore throat. He too suffered numerous
martyrdoms. 5. S. Christopher. 6. S. Cyriacus, Martyr, 309, concerning
whom many legends are told of his having delivered two princesses from
incurable maladies. 7. S. Dionysius, the Areopagite, converted by S.
Paul, and consecrated by him Bishop of Athens, afterwards called to
Rome by S. Peter, and made Bishop of Paris. 8. S. Erasmus, a bishop in
Syria, after enduring many tortures there, he was thrown into prison,
and delivered by an angel, who sent him to preach Christianity in
Italy, he died at Gaeta 303. At Naples and other places he is honoured
as S. Elmo. 9. S. Eustachius, originally called Placidus, a Roman
officer, converted while hunting by meeting a stag which carried a
refulgent cross between its horns; his subsequent reverses, his loss of
wife and children, the wonderful meeting with them again, and the
agency of animals throughout, make his one of the most romantic of
legends. 10. S. George. 11. S. Catherine of Alexandria. 12. S.
Margaret. 13. S. Pantaleone, another student of medicine; when, after
many tortures, he was finally beheaded, the legend tells us that, in
token of the purity of his life, milk flowed from his veins instead of
blood, <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 380. 14. S. Vitus, a Sicilian,
instructed by a slave, who was his nurse, in the Christian faith in his
early years; his father&rsquo;s endeavours to root out his belief were
unavailing, and he suffered <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 303, at not
more than twelve years of age. The only link I can discover in this
chain of saints is that they are all but one or two, whose alleged end
I do not know, as S. Christopher, credited with having suffered a
plurality of terrible martyrdoms. To each is of course ascribed the
patronage over some special one of the various phases of human
suffering.</p>

<p class="first">When, after our forced <i lang="fr">d&eacute;tour</i>,

hands of the gentle Tirolese.</p>
<p>Kufstein, however, is not gentle in appearance. Its vast fortress
seems to shed a stifling gloom over the whole place; it looks so hard
and selfish and tyrannical, that you long to get away from its
influence. Noble hearts from honest Hungary have pined away within its
cold strong grasp; and many a time, as my sketch-book has been turned

it wears a grand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=

<p>When Margaretha Maultasch ceded the country she found herself unable
to govern, to Austria at the earnest request of her people, in 1363, it
was stipulated that Kufstein, <span class="corr" id="xd21e1881" title=
"Source: Kitzb&uuml;hl">Kitzb&uuml;hel</span>, and Rattenberg, which
had been added to it by her marriage with Louis of Bradenburg, should
revert to Bavaria. These three dependencies were recovered by the
Emperor Maximilian in 1504, the two latter accepting his allegiance
gladly, the former holding out stoutly against him. The story of the
reduction of this stronghold is almost a stain on his otherwise prudent
and prosperous reign.</p>
<p>Pienzenau, its commander, who was in the Bavarian interest, had
particularly excited his ire by setting his men to sweep away with
brooms the traces of the small damage which had been effected by his
cannon, placed at too great a distance to do more than graze the
massive walls. Philip von Recenau, Regent of Innsbruck, meantime cast
two enormous field-pieces, which received the names of <i lang=
"de">Weckauf</i> and <i lang="de">Purlepaus</i>. These entirely turned
the tide of affairs. Chronicles of the time do not mention their
calibre, but declare that their missiles not only pierced the
&lsquo;fourteen feet-thick wall&rsquo; through and through, but entered
a foot and a half into the living rock. Pienzenau&rsquo;s heart misgave
him when he saw the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55"
name="pb55">55</a>]</span>work of these destructive engines, and
hastened to send in his submission to the Emperor; but it was too late.
&lsquo;So he is in a hurry to throw away his brooms at last, is
he?&rsquo; cried Maximilian. &lsquo;But he should have done it before.
He has allowed the wall of this noble castle to be so disgracefully
shattered, that he can make no amends but by giving up his own carcass
to the same fate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No entreaty could move the Emperor from carrying out this
chastisement, and some five-and-twenty of the principal men who had
held out against him were condemned to be beheaded on the spot. When
eleven had fallen before the headsman&rsquo;s sword, Erich, Duke of
Brunswick, sickening at the scene of blood, pleaded so earnestly with
the Emperor, that he obtained the pardon of the rest. The eleven were
buried by the pious country-people in a common grave; and who will may
yet tread the ground where their remains rest in a little chapel built
over their grave at Ainliff (dialectic for eleven), on the other side
of the river Inn.</p>
<p>Its situation near the frontier has made it the scene of other
sieges, of which none is more endeared to Tiroleans than that of 1809,
when the patriot Speckbacher distinguished himself by many a dauntless
deed.</p>
<p>If Kufstein has long had a truce to these stirring memories, many a
fantastic story has floated out of it concerning the prisoners
harboured there, even of late years. The Hungarian patriot brigand,
Rocsla Sandor (Andrew Roshla), who won by his unscrupulous daring
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>quite a legendary place in popular story, was long
confined here. He was finally tried and condemned (but I think not
executed) at Szeghedin, in July 1870; 454 other persons were included
in the same trial, of whom 234 under homicidal charges; 100 homicides
were laid to his charge alone, but there is no doubt that his services
to the popular cause, at the same time that they condoned some of his
excesses, in the popular judgment may have disposed the authorities to
exaggerate the charges against him. The whole story is fantastic, and
even in Kufstein, where he was almost an alien, there was admiration
and sympathy underlying the shudder with which the people spoke of him.
A much more interesting and no less romantic narrative, was told me of
a Hungarian political prisoner, who formed the solitary instance of an
escape from the stony walls of the fortress. His lady-love&mdash;and
she was a lady by birth&mdash;with the heroic instincts of a Hungarian
maiden, having with infinite difficulty made out where he was confined,
followed him hither in peasant disguise, and with invincible
perseverance succeeded, first in engaging herself as servant to the
governor and then in conveying every day to her lover, in his soup, a
hank of hemp. With this he twisted a rope and got safely away; and this
occurred not more than six or seven years ago.</p>
<p>St. Louis&rsquo;s day fell while we were at Kufstein&mdash;the
name-day of the King of Bavaria; and being the border town, the polite
Tiroleans make a complimentary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"
href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>f&ecirc;te of it. There was a
grand musical Mass, which the officers from the Bavarian frontier
attended, and a modest banquet was offered them after it. The peasants
put on their holiday attire&mdash;passable enough as far as the men are
concerned, but consisting mainly on the women&rsquo;s behalf in an ugly
black cloth square-waisted dress, and a black felt broad-brimmed hat,
with large gold tassels lying on the brim. After Mass the Bavarian
national hymn was sung to the familiar strains of our own.</p>
<p>All seemed gay and glad without. I returned to the primitive
rambling inn; everyone was gone to take his or her part in the Kufstein
idea of a holiday. There were three entrances, and three staircases; I
took a wrong one, and in trying to retrace my steps passed a room
through the half-open door of which I heard a sound of moaning, which
arrested me. I could not find it in my heart to pass on. I pushed the
door gently aside, and discovered a grey-haired old man lying
comfortlessly on the bed in a state of torpor. I laid him back in a
posture in which he could breathe more freely, opened his collar and
gave him air, and with the aid of one or two simple means soon brought
him back to consciousness. The room was barely furnished; his luggage
was a small bundle tied in a handkerchief, his clothes betokened that
he belonged to the respectable of the lower class. I was too desirous
to converse with a genuine Tirolean peasant to refuse his invitation to
sit down by his side. I had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=
"#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>soon learnt his tale, which he seemed
not a little pleased to find had an interest for a foreigner.</p>
<p>His lot had been marked by severe trials. In early youth he had been
called to lose his parents; in later life, the dear wife who had for a
season clothed his home again with brightness and hope. In old age he
had had a heavier trial still. His only child, the son whom he had
reared in the hope that he would have been the staff of his declining
years, whom he had brought up in innocence in childhood, and shielded
from knowledge of evil in early youth, had gone from him, and he knew
not where to find him. The boy had always had a fancy for a roving
adventurous life, but it had been his hope to have kept him always near
him, free from the contamination of great cities.</p>
<p>I asked if it was not the custom in these parts for young men to go
abroad and seek employment where it was more highly paid, and come back
and settle on their earnings. But he shook his head proudly. It was so
in Switzerland, it was so in some few valleys of Tirol, and the poor
Engadeiners supplied all the cities of Europe with confectioners; but
his son had no need to tramp the world in search of fortune. But what
had made him most anxious was, that the night before his son left some
wild young men had passed through the village. They were bold and
uproarious, and his fear was that his boy might have been tempted to
join them. He did not know exactly what their game was, but he had an
idea they were gathering recruits to join the lawless <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>Garibaldian bands in their attempts upon the Roman
frontier. With their designs he was confident his son had no sympathy.
If he had stopped to consider them, he would have shrunk from them with
horror; and it was his dread that his spirited love of danger and
excitement had carried him into a vortex from which he might by-and-by
be longing to extricate himself in vain. It was to pray that the lad
might be guided aright that he made this pilgrimage up the
Thierberg&mdash;no easy journey for one of his years. He had come
across hill and valley from a village of which I forget the name, but
situated near Sterzing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Sterzing itself is a place of pilgrimage,&rsquo; I said,
glad to turn to account my scanty knowledge of the sacred places of the
country. &lsquo;Why did you come all this way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed is Sterzing,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;a place of
benedictions. It is the spot where Sterzing, our first hermit, lived,
and left his name to our town. But <i>this</i> is the spot for those
who need penance. There, in that place,&rsquo; and as I followed the
direction of his hand I saw through the low lattice window the lofty
elevation of the Thierberg like a phantom tower, enveloped in mist,
standing out against the clear sky beyond, and wondered how his palsied
limbs had carried him up the steep. &lsquo;In that place, in olden
time, lived a true penitent. Once it was a lordly castle, and he to
whom it belonged was a rich and honoured knight; but on one occasion he
forgot his knightly honour, and with false vows led <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>astray
an unthinking maiden of the village. Soon, however, the conviction of
his sin came back to him clear as the sun&rsquo;s light, and without an
hour&rsquo;s hesitation he put it from him. To the girl he made the
best amends he could by first leading her to repentance, then procuring
her admission to a neighbouring convent. But for him, from that day the
lordly castle became as a hermit&rsquo;s cell, the sound of mirth and
revelry and of friendly voices was hushed for ever. The memory of his
own name even he would have wiped out, and would have men call him
only, as they do to the present day, &lsquo;<i lang="de">der
B&uuml;sser</i>&rsquo;&mdash;the Penitent. And so many has his example
brought to this shrine in a spirit of compunction, that the Church has
endowed it with the indulgence of the Portiuncula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What a picture of Tirolese faith it was! Instead of setting in
motion the detective police, or the telegraph-wire, or the second
column of the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; this old man had come many miles in
the opposite direction from that his child was supposed to have taken,
to bring his burden and lay it before a shrine he believed to have been
made dear to heaven by tears of penance in another age, and there
commend his petition to God that He might bring it to pass, accepting
the suffering as a merited chastisement in a spirit of sincere
penitence!</p>
<p>He was feeling better, and I rose to go. He pressed my hand in
acknowledgment of my sympathy, and I assured him of it. It was not a
case for more substantial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href=
"#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>charity; I had gathered from his
recital that he had no lack of <span class="corr" id="xd21e1935" title=
"Source: wordly">worldly</span> means. I only strove at parting to
kindle a ray of hope. I said after all it might not be so bad as he
imagined; his boy had been well brought up, and might perhaps be
trusted to keep out of the way of evil. It was thoughtless of him not
to seek his father&rsquo;s blessing and consent to his choice of an
adventurous career, but it might be he had feared his opposition, and
that he had no unworthy reason for concealing his plans. There was at
least as much reason to hope as to despond, and he must look forward to
his coming back, true to the instincts of his mountain home, wiser than
he had set out.</p>
<p>His pale blue eye glistened, and he gasped like one who had seen a
vision. &lsquo;Ay! just so! Just so it appeared to me when I was on the
Thierberg this morning! And now, in case my weak old heart did not see
it clearly enough, God, in His mercy, has sent you to expound the thing
more plainly to me. Now I know that I am heard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor old man! I shuddered lest the hope so strongly entertained
should prove delusive in the end. I may never know the result; but I
felt that at all events as he was one who took all things at
God&rsquo;s hands, nothing could, in one sense, come amiss; and for the
present, at least, I saw that he went down to his house comforted.</p>
<p>I strolled along the street, and, possessed with the type of the
Tirolean peasant, as I received it from this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>old man,
I conceived a feeling of deeper curiosity for all whom I met by the
way. I thought of them as of men for whom an unseen world is a reality;
who estimate prayer and sacraments and the intercession of saints above
steam-power and electricity. At home one meets with one such now and
then, but to be transported into a whole country of them was like
waking up from a long sleep to find oneself in the age of St. Francis
and St. Dominic.</p>
<p>Whatever faults the Tirolese may have to answer for, they will not
arise from religion being put out of sight. No village but has its
hillside path marked with &lsquo;the Way of the Cross;&rsquo; no bridge
but carries the statue of S. John Nepomucene, the martyr of the
Confessional; no fountain but bears the image of the local saint, a
model of virtue to the place; no lone path unmarked by its way-side
chapel, or its crucifix shielded from the weather by a rustic roof; no
house but has its outer walls covered with memories of holy things; no
room without its sacred prints and its holywater stoup. The churches
are full of little rude pictures, recording scenes in which all the
pleasanter events of life are gratefully ascribed to answers to prayer,
while many who cannot afford this more elaborate tribute hang up a
tablet with the words <i lang="de">Hat geholfen</i> (&lsquo;He has
helped me&rsquo;), or more simply still, &lsquo;<i lang="de">aus
Dankbarkeit</i>.&rsquo; Longfellow has written something very true and
pretty, which I do not remember well enough to quote; but most will
call to mind the verses about leaving landmarks, which a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>weary
brother seeing, may take heart again; and it is incalculable how these
good people may stir up one another to hope and endurance by such
testimonies of their trust in a Providence. Sometimes, again, the
little tablets record that such an one has undertaken a journey.
&lsquo;<i lang="de">N. N. reiset nach N.</i>, pray for him;&rsquo; and
we, who have come so far so easily, smile at the short distance which
is thought worthy of this importance. The <i lang="de">Gott segne meine
Reise</i>&mdash;&lsquo;May God bless my journey&rsquo;&mdash;seems to
come as naturally to them, however, as &lsquo;grace before meat&rsquo;
with us. But most of all, their care is displayed in regard to the dear
departed. The spot where an accident deprived one of his life is sacred
to all. &lsquo;The honourable peasant N. N. was run over here by a
heavy waggon;&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Here was N. N. carried away by the
waters of the stream;&rsquo; with the unfailing adjunct, &lsquo;may he
rest in peace, let us pray for him;&rsquo; or sometimes, as if there
were no need to address the recommendation to his own neighbours,
&lsquo;Stranger! pray for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>The straggling village on the opposite bank of the Inn is called
Zell, though appearing part of Kufstein. It affords the best points for
viewing the gloomy old fortress, and itself possesses one or two
chapels of some interest. At Kiefersfelden, at a short distance on the
Bavarian border, is the so-called Ottokapelle, a Gothic chapel marking
the spot where Prince Otho quitted his native soil when called to take
possession of the throne of Greece. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64"
href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>Kundl, about an hour from Kufstein, the third station, by
rail,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1971src" href="#xd21e1971" name=
"xd21e1971src">2</a> though wretchedly provided with accommodation, is
the place to stop at to visit the curious and isolated church of
<i lang="de">S. Leonhard auf der Wiese</i> (in the meadow), and it is
well worthy of a visit. In the year 1004 a life-sized stone image of
St. Leonard was brought by the stream to this spot;
&lsquo;floating,&rsquo; the wonder-loving people said, but it may well
be believed that some rapid swollen torrent had carried the image away
in its wild course from some chapel on a higher level. The people not
knowing whence it came, reckoned its advent a miracle, and set it up in
the highway, that all who passed might know of it. It was not long
before a no less illustrious wayfarer than the Emperor Henry II. came
that way, and seeing the uncovered image set up on high, stopped to
inquire its history. When he had heard it, he vowed that if his arms
were prosperous in Italy he would on his return build the saint an
honourable church. Success indeed attended him in the campaign, and he
was crowned Emperor at Pavia, but St. Leonard and his vow were alike
forgotten. The year 1012 brought him again into Italy through Tirol,
and passing the spot where he had registered his vow before, his horse,
foaming and stamping, refused to pass the image or carry him further.
The circumstance reminded him of his promise, and he at once set to
work to carry it out worthily. The church was completed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>within a
few years, but an unhappy accident signalized its completion. A young
man who had undertaken to place the ornament on the summit was seized
with vertigo in the moment of completing his exploit, and losing his
balance was dashed lifeless on to the ground below.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1985src" href="#xd21e1985" name="xd21e1985src">3</a> His
remains were gathered up tenderly by the neighbours, and his skull laid
as an offering at the foot of the crucifix on the high altar, where it
yet remains. An inscription to the following effect is preserved in the
church: &lsquo;<span lang="la"><span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1019
Pr&aelig;sens ecclesia Sti. Leonhardi a sancto Henrico Imperatore
exstructa, et anno 1020 a summo Pontifice Benedicto VIII. consecrata
est</span>,&rsquo; though there would not seem to be any other record
of the Pope having made the journey. S. Kunigunda, consort of Henry
II., bore a great affection to the spot, and often visited it.</p>
<p>The image of St. Leonard now in the church bears the date of 1481,
and there is no record of the time when it was substituted for the
original.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2001src" href="#xd21e2001" name=
"xd21e2001src">4</a> The interior has suffered a great deal during the
whitewash period; but some of the original carvings are remarkable,
particularly the grotesque creatures displayed on the main columns. On
one a doubled-bodied lion is trampling on two dragons; on another a
youth stands holding the prophetic roll of the book of revelation, and
a hideous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>symbolical figure, with something of the form of a
bear, cowers before him, showing a certain resemblance to the
sculptures in the chapel-porch of Castle Tirol. Round the high altar
are ten pilasters, each setting forth the figure of a saint, and all
various. A great deal of the old work was destroyed, however, when it
was rebuilt, about the year 1500.</p>
<p>Between St. Leonhard and Ratfield runs the
Aufl&auml;ngerbr&uuml;ndl&mdash;so called from the Angerberg,
celebrated as itself a very charming excursion from Kundl&mdash;a
watercourse directed by the side of the road through the charity of the
townspeople of Rattenberg and Ratfeld, in the year 1424, with the view
that no wayfarer might faint by the way for want of a drink of pure and
refreshing water.</p>
<p>Rattenberg is a little town of some importance on account of the
copper works in the neighbourhood, but not much frequented by visitors,
though it has three passable inns. It is curious that the castle of
Rottenburg near Rothholz, though so like in name, has a different
derivation, the latter arising from the red earth of the neighbourhood,
and the former from an old word <i lang="de">Rat</i>, meaning
&lsquo;richness,&rsquo; and in old documents it is found spelt <i lang=
"de">Rat in berc</i> (riches in the mountain). This was the favoured
locality of the holy Nothburga&rsquo;s earthly career.</p>
<p>St. Nothburga is eminently characteristic of her country. She was
the poorest of village maidens, and yet attained the highest and most
lasting veneration of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67"
name="pb67">67</a>]</span>her people by the simple force of virtue. She
was born in 1280. The child of pious parents, she drank in their good
instructions with an instinctive aptitude. Their lessons of pure and
Christian manners seemed as it were to crystallize and model themselves
in her conduct; she grew up a living picture of holy counsels. She was
scarcely seventeen when the lord of Castle Rottenburg, hearing of her
perfect life, desired to have her in his household. Her parents,
knowing she could have no better protectors, when they were no more,
than their honoured knight Henry of Rottenburg and his good wife Gutta,
gladly accepted the proposal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2023src" href=
"#xd21e2023" name="xd21e2023src">5</a> In her new sphere Nothburga
showed how well grounded was her virtue. It readily adapted itself to
her altered position, and she became as faithful and devoted to her
employers as she had been loving and obedient to her parents. In time
she was advanced to the highest position of trust in the castle, and
the greatest delight of her heart was fulfilled when she was nominated
to superintend the distribution of alms to the poor. Her prudence
enabled her to distinguish between real and feigned need, and while she
delighted in ministering to the one, she was firm in resisting the
appeals of the other. Her general uprightness won for her the respect
of all with whom she had to do, and she was the general favourite of
all classes.</p>
<p>Such bright days could not last; the enemy of God&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>saints looked on with envy, and desired to
&lsquo;sift&rsquo; her &lsquo;as wheat.&rsquo; The knight&rsquo;s son,
Henry VI., in <span class="corr" id="xd21e2030" title=
"Source: process">progress</span> of time brought home his bride,
Ottilia by name; and according to local custom, the older Knight Henry
ceded his authority to the young castellan, living himself in
comparative retirement. Ottilia was young and thoughtless, and haughty
to boot, and it was not without a feeling of bitter resentment that she
saw both her husband and his parents looked to Nothburga to supply her
deficiencies in the management of the household. She resolved to get
rid of the faithful servant, and her fury against her was only
increased in proportion as she realized that the perfect uprightness of
her conduct rendered it impossible to discover any pretext for
dismissing her.</p>
<p>For Nothburga it was a life of daily silent martyrdom. There were a
thousand mortifications in her mistress&rsquo;s power to inflict, and
she lost no opportunity of annoying her, but never once succeeded in
ruffling the gentleness of her spirit. &lsquo;My life has been too easy
hitherto,&rsquo; she would say in the stillness of her own heart;
&lsquo;now I am honoured at last by admission to the way of the
Cross.&rsquo; There was no brightness, no praise, no subsequent hope of
distinction, to be derived from her patience; they were stabs in the
dark, seen by no human eye, which made her bleed day by day. Yet she
would not complain, much less seek to change her service. She said it
would have been ungrateful to her first benefactors and employers to
leave them, so long <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69"
name="pb69">69</a>]</span>as she could spend herself for them, and
ungrateful to God to shirk the trial He had lovingly sent her.</p>
<p>A crucial test of her fidelity, however, was at hand. The day came
when Knight Henry and Gutta his wife were called to their long rest,
and with them the chief protection of Nothburga departed. She was now
almost at Ottilia&rsquo;s mercy. One of the first consequences of this
change was that she was deprived of her favourite office of relieving
the poor; and not only their customary alms were stopped, but their
dole of food also; and as a final provocation, she was required to feed
the pigs with the broken meat which she had been accustomed to husband
for the necessitous.</p>
<p>The good girl&rsquo;s heart bled to see the needy whom she had been
wont to relieve turned hungry away. The only means that occurred to her
of remedying the evil in some measure, was to deny herself her own food
and distribute it among them. Restricting her own diet to bread and
water, she saved a little basketful, which she would take down every
evening when work was done to the foot of the Leuchtenburg, where the
poorest of the castle dependents lived; and the blessing which
multiplied the loaves in the wilderness made her scanty savings suffice
to feed all who had come to beg of her.</p>
<p>That Nothburga contrived to feed the poor of a whole district, in
spite of her orders to the contrary, of course became in time a ground
of complaint for Ottilia. She had now a plausible reason for stirring
up the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>Knight Henry against her. He had always defended
her, out of regard for his parents&rsquo; memory; but coming one
evening past the Leuchtenburg, at Ottilia&rsquo;s instigation, he met
Nothburga with her little burden, and asked her what she carried.</p>
<p>Here the adversary of the saints had prepared for her a great trial,
says the legend. She, in her innocence, told fairly and honestly the
import of her errand; but to the Knight&rsquo;s eyes, who had meantime
untied her apron, the contents appeared, the legend says, to be wood
shavings; and further, putting the wine-flask to his lips, it seemed to
him to contain soap-suds. To her charitable intention he had made no
objection, but at this, which appeared to him a studied affront, he was
furious. He would listen to no explanation, but, returning at once to
the castle, he gave Ottilia free and full leave to deal with the
offending handmaiden as she pleased. Ottilia readily put the permission
into effect by directing the castle guard to forbid her, on her return,
ever again to pass the threshold of the castle.</p>
<p>This blow told with terrible effect on the poor girl. During her
service at the castle both her parents had died; she had now no home to
resort to. Putting her trust in God, however, she retraced her steps
alone through the darkness, and found shelter in a cottage of one of
her clients. Her path was watched by the angels, who marked the track
with fair seeds; and even to this day the hill-side which her feet so
often pressed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>on her holy errand is said to be marked with a
peculiar growth of flowers.</p>
<p>The next day she applied to a peasant of Eben to engage her as a
field labourer. The peasant was exceedingly doubtful of her capacity
for the work after the comparatively delicate nature of her previous
mode of life. Her hardy perseverance and determination, aided by the
grace of God, on which she implicitly relied, overcame all obstacles,
and old Valentine soon found that her presence brought a blessing on
all his substance. She had been with him about a year, when one day,
being Saturday, he was very anxious to gather in the remainder of his
harvest before an apprehended storm, and desired Nothburga, with the
other reapers, to continue their labours after the hour of eve, when
the holy rest was reckoned to have commenced. Nothburga, usually so
obedient to his wishes, had the courage to refuse to infringe the
commandment of religion; and to manifest that the will of God was on
her side, showed him her sickle resting from labour, suspended in the
air. Valentine, convinced by the prodigy, yielded to her
representations, and her piety was more and more honoured by all the
neighbours.</p>
<p>Soon after this, Ottilia, in the midst of her health and strength,
was stricken with a dangerous illness. In presence of the fear of death
she remembered her harsh treatment of Nothburga, and sent for her to
make amends for the past. As the good girl reached her bed-side she was
just under the influence of a frightful <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>attack of fevered
remorse. Her long golden hair waved in untended masses over the pillow,
like the flames of purgatory; her eyes glared like wheels of fire.
Unconscious of what was passing round her, and filled only with her
distempered fancies, she cried piteously: &lsquo;Drive away those
horrid beasts! don&rsquo;t let them come near me! And why do you let
those pale-faced creatures pursue me with their hollow glances? If I
did deny them food, I cannot help it now! Oh! keep those horrid swine
off me! If I did give them the portion of the poor, it is no reason you
should let them defile me and trample on me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothburga was melted with compassion, and her glance of sympathy
seemed to chase away the horrid vision. Come to herself, and calm
again, Otillia recognized her and begged her pardon, which we may well
believe she readily accorded; and shortly after, having reconciled
herself to God with true compunction, she fell asleep in
peace.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2060src" href="#xd21e2060" name=
"xd21e2060src">6</a></p>
<p>Henry proposed to Nothburga to come and resume <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>her old
post in the castle, and moreover to add to it that of superintending
the nurture of his only boy. Nothburga gladly accepted his offer, but,
in her strict integrity, insisted on accepting no remission from the
three years&rsquo; service under which she had bound herself to
Valentine. This concluded, she was received back with open arms at
Castle Rottenburg, whither she took with her one of Valentine&rsquo;s
daughters to instruct in household duties, that she might be meet to
succeed her when her time should come.</p>
<p>Days of peace on earth are not for the saints. Her fight was fought
out. The privations she had undergone in sparing her food for the poor,
and her subsequent exposure in the field, brought on an illness, under
which she shortly after sank. In conformity with her express desire,
her body was laid on a bier, to which two young oxen were yoked, and
left to follow their own course. The willing beasts tramped straight
away over hill and dale and water-course till they came to the village
of Eben, then consisting of but a couple of huts of the poor tillers of
the soil, and Valentine&rsquo;s homestead; now, a thriving village, its
two inns crowded every holiday with peasants, who make their excursions
coincide with a visit of devotion to the peasant maiden&rsquo;s shrine.
A small field-chapel of St. Ruprecht was then the only place of
devotion, but here next morning the body of the holy maiden was found
carefully laid at the foot of the altar, and here it was reverently
buried, and for centuries it has been honoured by all the country
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>round.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2071src" href=
"#xd21e2071" name="xd21e2071src">7</a> In 1434 the Emperor Maximilian,
and Christopher, Prince-Bishop of Brixen, built a church over the spot,
of which the ancient chapel served as the quire. In 1718 Gaspar
Ignatius, Count of K&uuml;nigl, the then Prince-Bishop, had the remains
exhumed, and carried them with pomp to the neighbouring town of
Schwatz, where they were left while the church was restored, and an
open sarcophagus prepared for them to remain exposed for the veneration
of the faithful, which was completed in 1738. In 1838 a centenary
festival was observed with great rejoicing, and on March 27, 1862, the
cycle of Nothburga&rsquo;s honour was completed in her solemn
canonization at Rome.</p>
<p>The lords of Rottenburg had had possession of this territory, and
had been the most powerful family of Tirol, ever since the eighth
century; one branch extending its sway over the valleys surrounding the
Inn, and another branch commanding the country bordering the Etsch;
Leuchtenburg and Fleims being the chief fortress-seats of these latter.
Their vast power greatly harassed the rulers of Tirol. In every
conflict between the native or Austrian princes and the Dukes of
Bavaria their influence would always turn the scale, and they often
seem to have exercised it simply to show their power. Their family
pride grew so high, that it became <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75"
href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>a proverb among the people. It
was observed that just during the period of the holy Nothburga&rsquo;s
sojourn in the castle the halo of her humble spirit seemed to exercise
a charm over their ruling passion. That was no sooner brought to a
close than it once more burst forth, and with intenser energy, and by
the end of a century more so blinded them that they ventured on an
attempt to seize the supreme power over the land. Friedrich <i lang=
"de">mit der leeren Tasche</i> was not a prince to lose his rights
without a worthy struggle; and then ensued one which was a noteworthy
instance of the protection which royalty often afforded to the poor
against the oppressions of a selfish aristocracy in the Middle Ages.
Friedrich was the idol of the people: in his youth his hardy
temperament had made him the companion not only of the mountain
huntsman, but even of the mountain hewer of wood. Called to rule over
the country, he always stood out manfully for the liberties of the
peasant and the burghers of the little struggling communities of Tirol.
The lords and knights who found their power thereby restricted were
glad to follow the standard of Henry VI., Count of Rottenburg, in his
rebellions. Forgetting all patriotism in his struggle for power, Henry
called to his aid the Duke of Bavaria, who readily answered his appeal,
reckoning that as soon as, by aiding Henry, he had driven Friedrich
out, he would shortly after be able to secure the prize for
himself.</p>
<p>The Bavarian troops, ever rough and lawless, now <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>began
laying waste the country in ruthless fashion. A Bavarian bishop, moved
to compassion by the sufferings of the poor people, though not of his
own flock, pleaded so earnestly with the Duke, that he made peace with
Friedrich, who was able to inflict due chastisement on Henry, for,
powerful as he was, he was no match for him as a leader. He fell
prisoner into Friedrich&rsquo;s hands, who magnanimously gave him his
liberty; but, according to the laws of the time, his lands and fiefs
were forfeit. Though the spirit of the high-minded noble was unbroken,
the darling aim of his race which had devolved upon him for execution
was defeated; his occupation gone, and his hopes quenched, he wandered
about, the last of his race, not caring even to establish himself in
any of the fiefs which he held under the Duke of Bavaria, and which
consequently yet remained to him.</p>
<p>The history of Henry VI. of Rottenburg has a peculiarly gloomy and
fantastic character. Ambitious to a fault, it was one cause of his ill
success that he exercised himself in the nobler pursuits of life rather
than in the career of arms. Letters of his which are still preserved
show that he owed the ascendancy he exercised over his neighbours quite
as much to his strength of character and grasp of mind as to his title
and riches. No complaint is brought against him in chronicles of the
time of niggardliness towards the Church, or of want of uprightness or
patience as a judge; he is spoken of as if he had learned to make
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>himself respected as well as feared. But he lived
apart in a lofty sphere of his own, seldom mixing in social
intercourse, while his refined tastes prevented his becoming an adept
in the art of war. Friedrich, on the other hand, who was a hero in the
field by his bravery, was also the favourite of the people through his
frank and ready-spoken sympathy. Henry had perhaps, on the whole, the
finer&mdash;certainly the more cultivated&mdash;character, but
Friedrich was more the man of the time; and it was this doom of
succumbing to one to whom he felt himself superior which pressed most
heavily on the last of the Rottenburgers. What became of him was never
known; consequently many wild stories became current to account for his
end: that he never laid his proud head low at the call of death, but
yet wanders on round the precincts where he once ruled; that his
untamable ambition made him a prey to the Power of Evil, who carried
him off, body and soul, to the reward of the proud; that, shunning all
sympathy and refusing all assistance, he died, untended and unknown, in
a spot far from the habitations of men. It would appear most probable,
however, that his death, like his life, was a contrast with the habits
of his age: it is thought that, unable to bear his humiliation, he fell
by his own hand within a twelvemonth of his defeat.</p>
<p>The deliverance from this powerful vassal, and the falling in of his
domains, tended greatly to strengthen and consolidate
Friederich&rsquo;s rule over Tirol, and ultimately <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>to
render the government of the country more stable, and more beneficial
to the people.</p>
<p>Not long after Henry VI.&rsquo;s disappearance a mysterious fire
broke out in the old castle on two separate occasions, laying the
greater part of it in ruins. But on each occasion it was noticed that
the devouring element, at the height of its fury, spared the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2104" title="Source: litle">little</span>
room which was honoured as that in which the holy Nothburga had
dwelt.</p>
<p>A gentler story about this neighbourhood is of a boy tending sheep
upon the neighbouring height, who found among some ruins a beautiful
bird&rsquo;s-nest. What was his surprise, on examining his treasure, to
find it full of broken shells which the fledglings had cast off and
left behind them, but shells of a most singular kind. Still greater was
his astonishment when, on showing them at home, his parents told him
they were no shells, but pieces of precious ore. The affair caused the
peasants to search in the neighbourhood, and led to the discovery of
one of those veins of metal the working of which brought so great
prosperity to Tirol in the fifteenth century, and which are not yet
extinct. Their discovery was always by accident, and often by occasion
of some curious incident, while the fact that such finds were to be hit
upon acted as a strong stimulant to the imagination of a romantic and
wonder-loving people, giving belief to all sorts of fables to tell how
the treasure was originally deposited, and how subsequently it was
preserved and guarded. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79"

represents Ottilia rushing in despair from her bed and wallowing in the
enclosure of the pigs, whence, with all Henry&rsquo;s care, she could
not be withdrawn alive. All the strength of his retainers was powerless
to restrain the beasts&rsquo; fury, and she was devoured, without
leaving a trace behind; only that now and then, on stormy nights, when
the pigs are grunting over their evening meal, some memory of their
strange repast seems to possess them, and the wail of Ottilia is heard
resounding hopelessly through the valley.</p>

of Europe, and I have more or less seen them all, I do not know any one

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Zillerthal claims to bear the palm over all the
Valleys of Tirol for natural beauty&mdash;a claim against which the
other valleys may, I think, find something to say.</p>
<p>There is an organised service of carriages (the road is only good
for an <i lang="de">einspanner</i>&mdash;one-horse vehicle) into the
Zillerthal, at both Brixlegg and Jenbach, taking between four and five
hours to reach Zell, an hour and a-half more to Mayrhofen. Its greatest
ornaments are the castles of Kropfsberg, Lichtwer, and Matzen; the
Reiterkogel and the Gerlos mountains, forming the present boundary
against Salzburg; and the Ziller, with its rapid current which gave it
its name (from <i lang="de">celer</i>),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2136src" href="#xd21e2136" name="xd21e2136src">1</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>its
tributary streams might very well have received the same appellation,
for their <i>celerity</i> is often so impetuous that great damage is
done to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Before starting for the Zillerthal I may mention two castles which
may also be seen from Jenbach, though like it they belong in strictness
to the chapter on the Left Inn-bank. One is Thurnegg by name, which was
restored as a hunting-seat by Archduke Ferdinand; and at the instance
of his second wife, the pious Anna Katharina of Mantua, he added a
chapel, in order that his hunting-parties might always have the
opportunity of hearing Mass before setting out for their sport.</p>
<p>Another is Tratzberg, which derived its name from its defiant
character. It is situated within an easy walk of Jenbach. Permission to
visit it is readily given, for it counts as a show-place. It may be
taken on the way to S. Georgenberg and Viecht, but it occupies too much
time, and quite merits the separate excursion by its collections and
its views. Frederick sold it in 1470 to Christian T&auml;nzel, a rich
mining proprietor of the neighbourhood, who purchased with it the right
to bear the title of Knight of Tratzberg. No expense was spared in its
decoration, and its paintings and marbles made it the wonder of the
country round. In 1573 it passed into the hands of the Fuggers, and at
the present day belongs to Count Enzenberg, who makes it an occasional
residence. A story is told of it which is in striking contrast to that
mentioned of Thurnegg. One of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81"
href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>knights of the castle in ancient
time had a reputation for caring more for the pleasures of the chase
than for the observances of religion. Though he could get up at an
early hour enough at the call of his <i lang=
"de">J&auml;ger&rsquo;s</i> horn, the chapel bell vainly wooed him to
Mass.</p>
<p>In vain morning by morning his guardian angel directed the sacred
sound upon his ear; the knight only rolled himself up more warmly in
the coverlet, and said, &lsquo;No need to stir yet, the dogs are not
brought round till five o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ding&mdash;dong&mdash;dang! Come&mdash;to&mdash;Mass!
Ding&mdash;dong&mdash;dang!&rsquo; sang the bells.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; yawned the knight, and covered his
ear with the bed-clothes.</p>
<p>The bell was silent, and the knight knew that the pious people who
had to work hard all day for their living, and yet spared half an hour
to ask God&rsquo;s blessing on their labours, were gone into the
chapel.</p>
<p>He fancied he saw the venerable old chaplain bowing before the
altar, and smiting his breast; he saw the faithful rise from their
knees while the glad tidings of the Gospel were announced, and they
proclaimed their faith in them in the Creed; he heard them fall on
their knees again while the sacred elements were offered on the altar
and the solemn words of the consecration pronounced; he saw little
Johann, the farrier&rsquo;s son, bow his head reverently on the steps,
and then sound the threefold bell which told of the most solemn moment
of the sacred mysteries; and the chapel bell took up the note,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>and announced the joyful news to those whom
illness or necessity forced to remain away.</p>
<p>Then hark! what was that? The rocks under the foundation of the
castle rattled together, and all the stones of its massive walls
chattered like the teeth of an old woman stricken with fear. The three
hundred and sixty-five windows of the edifice rattled in their
casements, but above them all sounded the piercing sound of the
knight&rsquo;s cry of anguish. The affrighted people rushed into the
knight&rsquo;s chamber; and what was their horror when, still sunk in
the soft couch where he was wont to take his ease, there he lay dead,
while his throat displayed the print of three black and burning claws.
The lesson they drew was that the knight, having received from his
guardian angel the impulse to repair his sloth by at least <i>then</i>
rising to pay the homage which the bell enjoined, had rejected even
this last good counsel, thereby filling up the measure of his faults.
For years after marks were shown upon the wall as having been sprinkled
by his blood!</p>
<p>The first little town that reckons in the Zillerthal is Strass, a
very unpretending place, and then Schlitters.</p>
<p>At Schlitters they have a story of a butcher who, going to Strass to
buy an ox, had scarcely crossed the Zill and got a little way from
home, than he saw lying by the way-side a heap of the finest wheat. Not
liking to appropriate property which might have a legitimate owner, he
contented himself with putting a few grains in his pocket, and a few
into his sack, as a specimen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=
"#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>As he went by the way his pockets and
his sack began to get heavier and heavier, till it seemed as if the
weight would burst them through. Astonished at the circumstance he put
in his hand, and found them all full of shining gold. As soon as he had
recovered his composure, he set off at the top of his speed, and,
heeding neither hill or dale, regained the spot where he had first seen
the wheat. But it was no more to be seen. If he had had faith to
commend himself to God on his first surprise, say the peasants, and
made the holy sign of redemption, the whole treasure would have been
his.</p>
<p>There is another tradition at Schlitters of a more peculiar
character. It is confidently affirmed that the village once boasted two
churches, though but a very small one would supply the needs of the
inhabitants. Hormayr has sifted the matter to the bottom, and explains
it in this way. There lived in the neighbourhood two knights, one
belonging to the Rottenburger, and the other to the Freundsberger
family. Now the latter had a position of greater importance, but the
former possessed a full share of family haughtiness, and would not
yield precedence to any one. In order not to be placed on a footing of
inferiority, or even of equality, with his rival, he built a second
church, which he might attend without being brought into contact with
him. No expense was spared, and the church was solidly built enough;
but no blessing seemed to come on the edifice so built, no pains could
ever keep it in repair, and at last, after crumbling into ruin, every
stone of it disappeared. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href=
"#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>Kropfsberg is a fine ruin, belonging to Count Enzenberg, seen a
little above Strass, on a commanding height between the high road and
the Inn. It is endeared to the memory of the Tiroleans by having been
the spot where, on St. Michael&rsquo;s Day, 1416, their favourite
Friedrich <i lang="de">mit der leeren Tasche</i> was reconciled with
his brother Ernst <i lang="de">der Eiserne</i>, who, after the Council
of Constance had pronounced its ban on Frederick, had thought to
possess himself of his dominions.</p>
<p>The largest town of the Zillerthal is F&uuml;gen, a short distance
below Schlitters, and the people are so proud of it, that they have a
saying ever in their mouths, &lsquo;There is but one Vienna and one
F&uuml;gen in the world!&rsquo; It doubtless owes its comparative
liveliness and prosperity to its <span lang="fr">ch&acirc;teau</span>
being kept up and often inhabited by its owners (the Countess of
D&ouml;nhof and her family). This is also a great ornament to the
place, having been originally built in the fifteenth century by the
lords of Fieger, though unhappily the period of its rebuilding (1733)
was not one very propitious to its style. The sculpture in the church
by the native artist, Nissl, is much more meritorious. The church of
Ried, a little further along the valley, is adorned with several very
creditable pictures by native artists. It is the native place of one of
the bravest of the defenders of throne and country, so celebrated in
local annals of the early part of the century, Sebastian Riedl. He was
only thirty-nine at his death in 1821. Once, on an occasion of his
fulfilling a mission to General <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85"
href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>Blucher, he received from him a
present of a hussar&rsquo;s jacket, which he wore at the battle of
Katzbach, and it is still shown with pride by his compatriots.</p>
<p>The Zillerthal was the only part of Tirol where Lutheranism ever
obtained any hold over the people. The population was very thin and
scattered, consequently they were out of the way of the regular means
of instruction in their own faith; and it often happened, when their
dwellings and lands were devastated by inundations, that they were
driven to seek a livelihood by carrying gloves, bags, and other
articles made of chamois leather, also of the horns of goats and
cattle, into the neighbouring states of Germany. Hence they often came
back imbued with the new doctrines, and bringing books with them, which
may have spread them further. This went on, though without attracting
much attention, till the year 1830, when they demanded permission to
erect a church of their own. The <i lang="de">St&auml;nde</i> of Tirol
were unanimous, however, to resist any infringement of the unity of
belief which had so long been preserved in the country. The Emperor
confirmed their decision, and gave the schismatics the option of being
reconciled with the Church, or of following their opinions in other
localities of the empire where Lutheran communities already existed. A
considerable number chose the latter alternative, and peace was
restored to the Zillerthal. Every facility was given them by the
government for making the move advantageously, and the inhabitants, who
had been long provoked by the scorn and ridicule <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>with
which the exiles had treated their time-honoured observances, held a
rejoicing at the deliverance.</p>
<p>At the farther end of the valley is Zell, which though smaller in
population than F&uuml;gen, has come to be considered its chief town.
Its principal inn, for there are several&mdash;<i lang="de">zum
Post</i>&mdash;if I recollect right, claims to be not merely a <i lang=
"de">Gasthaus</i>, but a <i lang="de">Gasthof</i>. The <i lang=
"de">Brauhaus</i>, however, with less pretension, is a charming resort
of the old-fashioned style, under the paternal management of Franz
Eigner, whose daughters sing their local melodies with great zest and
taste. The church, dedicated to St. Vitus, is modern, having been built
in 1771&ndash;82; but its slender green steeple is not inelegant. It
contains some meritorious frescoes by Zeiler. The town contains some
most picturesque buildings, as the Presbytery, grandiloquently styled
the <i lang="de">Dechanthof</i>, one or two educational establishments,
several well-to-do private houses, and the town-hall, once a
flourishing brewery, which failed&mdash;I can hardly guess how, for the
chief industry of the place is supplying the neighbourhood with
beer.</p>
<p>A mile beyond Zell is Hainzenberg, where the process of gold-washing
on a small scale may be studied, said to be carried on by the owner,
the Bishop of Brizen, on a sort of ultra-co-operative principle, as a
means of support to the people of the place, without profit to himself.
There is also a rather fine waterfall in the neighbourhood, and an inn
where luncheon may be had. The most interesting circumstance, perhaps,
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>connexion with Zell is the <i lang=
"de">Kirchweih-fest</i>, which is very celebrated in all the country
round. I was not fortunate enough to be in the neighbourhood at the
right time of year to witness it. On the other side of the Hainzenberg,
where the mountain climber can take his start for the Gerlozalp, is a
little sanctuary called <i lang="de">Mari&auml;-rastkapelle</i>, and
behind it runs a sparkling brook. Of the chapel the following singular
account is given:&mdash;In olden time there stood near the stream a
patriarchal oak sacred to Hulda;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2232src"
href="#xd21e2232" name="xd21e2232src">2</a> after the introduction of
Christianity the tree was hewn down, and as they felled it they heard
Hulda cry out from within. The people wanted to build up a chapel on
the spot in honour of the Blessed Virgin, and began to collect the
materials. No sooner had the labourers left their work, however, than
there appeared an army of ravens, who, setting themselves vigorously to
the task, carried every stone and every balk of wood to a neighbouring
spot. This happened day after day, till at last the people took it as a
sign that the soil profaned by the worship of Hulda was not pleasing to
heaven, and so they raised their chapel on the place pointed out by the
ravens, where it now stands.</p>
<p>After Mayrhof, the next village (with three inns), in the
neighbourhood of which garnets are found and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>mills
for working them abound, the Zillerthal spreads out into numerous
branches of great picturesqueness, but adapted only to the hardy
pedestrian, as the Floitenthal, the Sondergrundthal, the Hundskehlthal
(Dog&rsquo;s-throat valley), the Stillupethal, with its Teufelsteg, a
bridge spanning a giddy ravine, and its dashing series of waterfalls.
The whole closed in by the Zemmer range and its glaciers, the boundary
against South-Tirol, said to contain some of the finest scenery and
best hunting-grounds in the country. It has been also called the
&lsquo;el Dorado&rsquo; of the botanist and the mineralogist. The most
important of these by-valleys is the Duxerthal, by non-Tiroleans
generally written Tuxerthal, a very high-lying tract of country, and
consequently one of the coldest and wildest districts of Tirol.
Nevertheless, its enclosed and secluded retreat retains a saying
perhaps many thousand years old, that once it was a bright and fertile
spot yielding the richest pastures, and that then the population grew
so wanton in their abundance that they wasted their substance. Then
there came upon them from above an icy blast, before which their
children and their young cattle sank down and died; and the herbage
was, as it were, bound up, and the earth was hardened, so that it only
brought forth scarce and stunted herbs, and the mountain which bounded
their pleasant valley itself turned to ice, and is called to this day
<i lang="de">die gefrorene Wand</i>, the frozen wall. The scattered
population of this remote valley numbered so few souls, that they
depended on neighbouring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=
"#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>villages for their ecclesiastical
care, and during winter when shut in by the snow within their natural
fastnesses, were cut off from all spiritual ministration, so that the
bodies of those who died were preserved in a large chest, of which the
remains are yet shown, until the spring made their removal to Mattrey
possible. In the middle of the seventeenth century they numbered 645
souls, and have now increased to about 1,400; about the year 1686 they
built a church of their own, which is now served by two or three
priests. For the first couple of miles the valley sides are so steep,
that the only level ground between them is the bed of an oft-times
torrential stream, but yet they are covered almost to the very top with
a certain kind of verdure; further on it widens out into the district
of Hinterdux, which is a comparatively pleasant cheerful spot, with
some of the small cattle (which are reared here as better adapted to
the gradients on which they have to find their food,) browsing about,
and sundry goats and sheep, quite at home on the steeps. But scarce a
tree or shrub is to be seen&mdash;just a few firs, and here and there a
solitary mountain pine; and in the coldest season the greatest
suffering is experienced from want of wood to burn. The only resource
is grubbing up the roots remaining from that earlier happier time,
which but for this proof might have been deemed fabulous.</p>
<p>The hardships which the inhabitants of this valley cheerfully
undergo ought to serve as a lesson of diligence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>indeed.
The whole grass-bearing soil is divided among them. The more prosperous
have a cow or more of their own, by the produce of which they live;
others take in cows from Innsbruck and Hall to graze. The butter they
make becomes an article of merchandise, the transport of which over the
mountain paths provides a hard and precarious livelihood for a yet
poorer class; the pay is about a halfpenny per lb. per day, and to make
the wage eke out a man will carry a hundred and a woman fifty to
seventy pounds through all weathers and over dangerous paths, sleeping
by night on the hard ground, the chance of a bundle of hay in winter
being a luxury; and one of their snow-covered peaks is with a certain
irony named the Federbett. They make some six or seven cwt. of cheese
in the year, but this is kept entirely for home consumption.</p>
<p>The care of these cattle involves a labour which only the strongest
constitution could stand&mdash;a continual climbing of mountains in the
cold, often in the dark, during great part of the year allowing
scarcely four or five hours for sleep. Nor is this their only industry.
They contrive also to grow barley and flax; this never ripens, yet they
make from it a kind of yarn, which finds a ready sale in Innsbruck;
they weave from it too a coarse linen, which helps to clothe them,
together with the home-spun wool of their sheep. Also, by an incredible
exercise of patience, they manage to heap up and support a sufficient
quantity of earth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"
name="pb91">91</a>]</span>round the rough and stony soil of their
valley to set potatoes, carrots, and other roots. Notwithstanding all
these hardships, they are generally a healthy race, remarkable for
their endurance, frugality, and love of home. Neither does their hard
life make them neglect the improvement of the mind; nowhere are schools
more regularly attended, although the little children have many of them
an hour or two&rsquo;s walk through the snow. The church is equally
frequented; so that if the great cold be sent, as the legend teaches,
as a chastisement,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2259src" href=
"#xd21e2259" name="xd21e2259src">3</a> the people seem to have had
grace given them to turn it to good account.</p>
<p>The Zemgrund, Zamsergrund, and the Schwarzensteingrund, are other
pedestrian excursions much recommended from Mayrhof, but all equally
require the aid of local guides, and have less to repay toil than those
already described.</p>
<p>Travellers who merely pass through Tirol by rail may catch a sight
of the mountains which hem in the Duxerthal, just after passing the
station of Steinach, on their left hand, when facing the south.

<p class="first">We had parted from the Zillerthal, and had once more
taken our places in the railway carriage at Jenbach for a short stage
to reach Kundl,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2301src" href="#xd21e2301"
name="xd21e2301src">1</a> as a base of operations for visiting the
Wildsch&ouml;nau, as well as the country on the other side of the Inn.
The entry was effected with the haste usual at small stations, where
the advent of a traveller, much more of a party of tourists, is an
exceptional event. The adjustment of our bags and rugs was greatly
facilitated by the assistance of the only occupant of the compartment
into which we were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93"
name="pb93">93</a>]</span>thrust; and when we had settled down and
expressed our thanks for his urbanity, I observed that he eyed us with
an amused but not unpleasant scrutiny. At last his curiosity overcame
his reticence. &lsquo;I have frequent occasion to travel this way to
Munich and Vienna,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I do not remember ever to
have fallen in with any strangers starting from Jenbach.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The conversation so opened soon revealed that our new friend, though
spending most of his time in the Bavarian and Austrian capitals,
nevertheless retained all a mountaineer&rsquo;s fondness for the
Tirolese land, which had given him birth some seventy years before. He
was greatly interested in our exploration of the Zillerthal, but much
annoyed that we were leaving instead of entering it; had it been the
other way, he said, he would have afforded us an acquaintance with
local customs such as, he was sure, no other part of Europe could
outvie. I assured him I had been disappointed at not coming across them
during our brief visit, but fully hoped on some future occasion to have
better success. He warmly recommended me not to omit the attempt, and
for my encouragement cited a local adage testifying to the attractions
of the valley&mdash;</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first xd21e2322">He was interesting us much in his
vividly-coloured sketches of peasant life, when the train came to a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>stand; the guard shouted &lsquo;Kundl,&rsquo; and
we were forced to part. He gave us an address in Munich, however, where
we were afterwards fortunate enough to find him; and he then gave me
some precious particulars, which I was not slow to garner.</p>
<p>He seemed to know the people well, having lived much among them in
his younger days, and claimed for them&mdash;perhaps with some little
partiality&mdash;the character of being industrious, temperate, moral,
and straightforward, even above the other dwellers in Tirol; and no
less, of being physically the finest race. Their pure bracing mountain
air, the severe struggle which nature wages with them in their
cultivation of the fruits of the soil, and the hardy athletic pursuits
with which they vary their round of agricultural labour, tend to
maintain and ever invigorate this original stock of healthfulness.
Their athletic games are indeed an institution to which they owe much,
and which they keep up with a devotion only second to that with which
they cultivate their religious observances. Every national and social
festival is celebrated with these games. The favourite is the <i lang=
"de">scheibenschiessen</i>, or shooting at a mark, for accuracy in
which they are celebrated in common with the inhabitants of all other
districts of the country, but are beaten by none; their <i lang=
"de">stutze</i> (short-barrelled rifle) they regard more in the light
of a friend and companion than a weapon, and dignify it with the
household name of the bread-winner. Wrestling is another favourite
sport; to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>the champion wrestler of the hamlet is a
distinction which no inhabitant of the Zillerthal would barter for
gold. The best &lsquo;<i lang="de">Haggler</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<i lang=
"de">Mairraffer</i>,&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i lang=
"de">Roblar</i>&rsquo;&mdash;three denominations of wrestlers&mdash;are
regarded somewhat in the light of a superior order of persons, and
command universal respect. In wilder times, it is true, this ran into
abuse; and some who had attained excellence in an art so dangerous when
misapplied betook themselves to a life of violence and freebooting; but
this has entirely passed away now, and anything like a highway robbery
is unheard of. The most chivalrous rules guard the decorum of the game,
which every bystander feels it a point of honour to maintain; the use
even of the <i lang="de">stossring</i>, a stout metal ring for the
little finger, by which a telling and sometimes disfiguring blow may be
given by a dexterous hand, is discouraged. It is still worn, however,
and prized more than as a mere ornament&mdash;as a challenge of the
wearer&rsquo;s power to wield it if he choose, or if provoked to show
his prowess. Running in races&mdash;which, I know not why, they call
<i lang="de">springen</i>&mdash;obtains favour at some seasons of the
year. At bowls and skittles, too, they are famous hands; and in their
passion for the games have originated a number of fantastic stories of
how the fairies and wild men of the woods indulge in them too. Many a
herdsman, on his long and solitary watch upon the distant heights,
gives to the noises of nature which he has heard, but could not account
for, an origin which lives in the imagination of those to whom he
recounts it on his return <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>home; and his fancies are recorded as
actual events. But that the spirits play at skittles, and with gold and
silver balls, is further confirmed by peasants who have lost their way
in mists and snow-storms, and whose troubled dreams have made pleasant
stories. One of these, travelling with his pedlar&rsquo;s pack, sought
refuge from the night air in the ruined castle of Starkenberg, the
proud stronghold of a feudal family, second only in importance to the
Rottenburgers, and equally brought low by Friedrich <i lang="de">mit
der leeren Tasche</i>. The pedlar was a bold wrestler, and felt no fear
of the airy haunters of ruined castles. He made a pillow of his pack,
and laid him down to sleep as cosily as if at home, in the long dank
grass; nevertheless, when the clock of the distant village
church&mdash;to whose striking he had been listening hour by hour with
joy, as an earnest that by the morning light he would know how to
follow its guiding to the inhabited locality it denoted&mdash;sang out
the hour of midnight, twelve figures in ancient armour stalked into the
hall, and set themselves to play at bowls, for which they were served
with skulls. The pedlar was a famous player, and nothing daunted, took
up a skull, and set himself to play against them, and beat them all;
then there was a shout of joy, such as mortal ears had never heard, and
the twelve spirits declared they were released. Scarcely had they
disappeared, when ten more spirits, whom the pedlar concluded like the
last to be retainers of the mighty Starkenberger of old, entered by
different doors, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97"
name="pb97">97</a>]</span>they carefully locked behind them, and then
bringing our hero the keys, begged him to open the doors each with the
right one. The pedlar was a shrewd fellow; and though doors, keys, and
spirits were each alike of their kind, his observation had been so
accurate that he opened each with the right key without hesitation,
whereupon the ten spirits declared themselves released too. Then came
in the Evil One, furious with the pedlar, who was setting free all his
captives, and swore he would have him in their stead. But the pedlar
demanded fair play, and offered to stake his freedom on a game with his
Arch-Impiety. The pedlar won, and the demon withdrew in ignominy; but
the released spirits came round their deliverer, and loaded him with as
much gold and valuable spoil as he could carry.</p>
<p>This story seemed to me to belong to a class not unfrequently met
with, but yet differing from the ordinary run of legends on this
subject, inasmuch as the spirits, who were generally believed to be
bound to earth in penance, were released by no act of Christian virtue,
and without any appeal to faith; and I could not help asking my old
friend if he did not think this very active clever pedlar might have
been one of those who according to his own version had indulged in
freebooting tendencies, and that having with a true
Zillerthaler&rsquo;s tendencies pined to return to his native valley,
he had invented the tale to account for his accession of fortune, and
the nature of his possessions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98"
href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>I think my friend was a little
piqued at my unmasking his hero, but he allowed it was not an
improbable solution for the origin of some similar tales.</p>
<p>Prizes, he went on to tell me, are often set up for excellence in
these games, which are cherished as marks of honour, without any
reference to their intrinsic value. And so jealously is every
distinction guarded, that a youth may not wear a feather or the sprig
of rosemary, bestowed by a beloved hand, in his jaunty hat, unless he
is capable of proving his right to it by his pluck and muscular
development.</p>
<p>Dancing is another favourite recreation, and is pursued with a zest
which makes it a healthful and useful exercise too. The <i lang=
"de">Schnodah&uuml;pfl</i> and the <i lang="de">Hosennagler</i> are as
dear to the Zillerthaler as the <i>Bolera</i> to the Andalusian or the
<i>Jota</i> to the Aragonese; like the Spanish <i lang=
"es">Seguidillas</i>, too, the Zillerthalers accompany their dance with
sprightly songs, which are often directed to inciting each other not to
flag.</p>
<p>Another amusement, in which they have a certain similarity with
Spaniards, is cow-fighting. But it is not a mere sport, and cruelty is
as much avoided as possible, for the beasts are made to fight only with
each other, and only their natural weapons&mdash;each other&rsquo;s
horns&mdash;are brought against them. The victorious cow is not only
the glory and darling of her owner, who loads her with garlands and
caresses; but the fight serves to ascertain the hardy capacity of the
animals as leaders of the herd, an office which is no sinecure,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>when they have to make their way to and from steep
pastures difficult of access.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2387src" href=
"#xd21e2387" name="xd21e2387src">3</a> Ram and goat fights are also
held in the same way, and with the same object.</p>
<p>The chief occasions for exercising these pastimes are the village
festivals, the <i lang="de">Kirchtag</i>, or anniversary of the Church
consecration, the Carnival season, weddings and baptisms, and the
opening of the season for the <i lang="de"><span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2405" title=
"Source: Scheibenchiessen">Scheibenschiessen</span></i>; also the days
of pilgrimages to various popular shrines; and the <i lang=
"de">Primizen</i> and <i lang="de">Sekundizen</i>&mdash;the first Mass
of their pastors, and its fiftieth anniversary&mdash;general festivals
all over Tirol.</p>
<p>A season of great enjoyment is the Carnival, which with them begins
at the Epiphany. Their great delight then is to go out in the dusk of
evening, when work is over, disguised in various fantastic dresses, and
making their way round from house to house, set the inmates guessing
who they can be. As they are very clever in arranging all the
accessories of their assumed character, changing their voice and mien,
each visit is the occasion of the most laughable mistakes. In the
towns, the Carnival procession is generally got up with no little taste
and artistic skill. The arch-buffoon goes on ahead, a loud and merry
jingle of bells announcing his advent at every movement of the horse he
bestrides, collects the people out of every house. Then follow,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>also mounted, a train of maskers, Turks,
soldiers, gipsies, pirates; and if there happen to be among them anyone
representing a judge or authority of any sort, he is always placed at
the head of the tribe. In the evening, their perambulations over, they
assemble in the inn, where the acknowledged wag of the locality reads a
humorous diatribe, which touches on all the follies and events, that
can be anyhow made to wear a ridiculous aspect, of the past year.</p>
<p>Christmas&mdash;here called <i lang="de">Christnacht</i> as well as
<i lang="de">Weihnacht</i>&mdash;is observed (as all over the country,
but especially here) by dispensing the <i lang="de">Kloubabrod</i>, a
kind of dough cake, stuffed with sliced pears, almonds, nuts, and
preserved fruits. The making of this is a particular item in the
education of a Zillerthaler maiden, who has a special interest in it,
inasmuch as the one she prepares for the household must have the first
cut in it made by her betrothed, who at the same time gives her some
little token of his affection in return. Speaking of Christmas customs
reminded my informant of an olden custom in Brixen, that the Bishop
should make presents of fish to his retainers. This fish was brought
from the Garda-see, and the Graf of Tirol and the Prince-bishop of
Trent were wont to let it pass toll-free through their dominions. A
curious letter is extant, written by Bishop R&ouml;tel, &lsquo;<i lang=
"de">an sambstag nach <span class="corr" id="xd21e2431" title=
"Source: St&oelig;">St&aelig;</span>. <span class="corr" id="xd21e2434"
title="Source: Barbar&oelig;">Barbar&aelig;</span>, 1444</i>,&rsquo;
courteously enforcing this privilege.</p>
<p>The <i lang="de">Sternsingen</i> is a favourite way of keeping the
Epiphany in many parts of the country. Three youths, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>one
of them with his face blackened, and all dressed to represent the three
kings, go about singing from homestead to homestead; and in some places
there is a Herod ready to greet them from the window with riming
answers to their verses, of which the following is a specimen: it is
the address of the first king&mdash;</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">K&ouml;nig Kaspar bin ich gennant</p>

<p class="first xd21e2322">Melchior, thus appealed to, stands forward
and sings his lay; and then Balthazar; and then the three join in a
chorus, in which certain hints are given that as they come from so far
some refreshment would be acceptable; upon which the friendly
peasant-wife calls them in, and regales them with cakes she has
prepared ready for the purpose, and sends them on their mountain-way
rejoicing. Possibly some such custom may have given rise to the
institution of our &lsquo;Twelfth-cake.&rsquo; In the &OElig;tzthal
they go about with the greeting, &lsquo;<span lang="de">Gelobt sei

found the Holy Family. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=

<p>Their wedding f&ecirc;tes seem to be among the most curious of all
their customs. My friend gave me a detailed account of one, between two
families of the better class of peasants, which he had attended some
years back; and he believed they were little changed since. It is
regarded as an occasion of great importance; and as soon as the banns
had been asked in church, the bridegroom went round with a chosen
friend styled a <i lang="de">Hochzeitsbitter</i>, to invite friends and
relations to the marriage. The night before the wedding (for which
throughout Tirol a Thursday is chosen, except in the Iselthal, where a
preference for Monday prevails), there was a great dance at the house
of the bride, who from the moment the banns have been asked is
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2476" title=
"Source: popuarly">popularly</span> called the <i lang=
"de">Kanzel-Braut</i>. &lsquo;Rather, I should say,&rsquo; he pursued,
&lsquo;it was in the barn; for though a large cottage, there was no
room that would contain the numbers of merry couples who flocked in,
and even the barn was so crowded, that the dancers could but make their
way with difficulty, and were continually tumbling over one another;
but it was a merry night, for all were in their local costume, and the
pine-wood torches shed a strange and festive glare over them. The next
morning all were assembled betimes. It was a bitterly cold day, but the
snow-storm was eagerly hailed, as it is reckoned a token that the
newly-wedded pair will be rich; we met first at the bride&rsquo;s house
for what they called the <i lang="de">Morgensuppe</i>, a rough sort of
hearty breakfast of roast meat, white bread, and sausages; and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>while the elder guests were discussing it, many
were hard at work again dancing, and the young girls of the village
were dressing up the bride&mdash;one of the adornments <i lang="fr">de
rigueur</i> being a knot of streamers of scarlet leather trimmed with
gold lace, and blue arm-bands and hat-ribbons; these streamers are
thought by the simple people to be a cure for goitres, and are
frequently bound round them with that idea. At ten o&rsquo;clock the
first church bell rang, when all the guests hastily assembled round the
table, and drank the health of the happy pair in a bowl from which they
had first drank. Then they ranged themselves into a procession, and
marched towards the church, the musicians leading the way. The nearest
friends of the bridal pair were styled &ldquo;train-bearers,&rdquo; and
formed a sort of guard of honour round the bride, walking bare-headed,
their hats, tastily wreathed with flowers, in their hands. The priest
of the village walked by the bride on one side, her parents on the
other. She wore a wreath of rosemary&mdash;a plant greatly prized here,
as among the people of Spain and Italy, and considered typical of the
Blessed Virgin&rsquo;s purity&mdash;in her hair; her holiday dress was
confined by a girdle, and she held her rosary in her hand. The
bridegroom was almost as showily dressed, and wore a crown of silver
wire; beside him walked another priest, and behind them came the host
of the village inn, a worthy who holds a kind of patriarchal position
in our villages. He is always one of the most important men of the
place, generally owns the largest holding of land, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>and
drives one or two little trades besides attending to the welfare of his
guests. But more than this, he is for the most part a man of upright
character and pleasant disposition, and is often called to act as
adviser and umpire in rural complications.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The procession was closed by the friends and neighbours,
walking two and two, husband and wife together; and the church bells
rang merrily through the valley as it passed along.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ceremonial in the church was accompanied with the best
music the locality could afford, the best singers from the neighbouring
choirs lending their voices. To add to the solemnity of the occasion,
lighted tapers were held by the bridal party at the Elevation; and it
was amusing to observe how the young people shunned a candle that did
not burn brightly, as that is held to be an omen of not getting married
within the year. At the close of the function, the priest handed round
to them the <i lang="de">Johannissegen</i>, a cup of spiced wine mixed
with water, which he had previously blessed, probably so called in
memory of the miracle at the wedding-feast recorded in the Gospel of
that Apostle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The band then struck up its most jocund air, and full of
mirth the gladsome party wended their way to the inn. After a light
repast and a short dance, and a blithesome <i lang="de">Trutzlied</i>,
they passed on, according to custom, to the next, and so on to all the
inns within a radius of a few miles. This absorbed about three or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>four hours; and then came the real wedding
banquet, which was a very solid and long affair&mdash;in fact, I think
fresh dishes were being brought in one after another for three or four
hours more. Even in this there was a memory of the Gospel narrative,
for in token of their joy they keep for the occasion a fatted calf, the
whole of which is served up joint by joint, not omitting the head; this
was preceded by soup, and followed by a second course of sweet
dumplings, with fruit and the inevitable pickled cabbage, which on this
day is dignified with the title of <i lang="de">Ehrenkraut</i>. After
this came a pause; and the musicians, who had been playing their
loudest hitherto, held in too. The &ldquo;best man&rdquo; rose, and
went through the formula of asking the guests whether they were content
with what had been set before them, which of course was drowned in a
tumult of applause. In a form, which serves from generation to
generation with slight change, he then went on to remark that the good
gifts of meat and drink of which they had partaken came from the hand
of God, and called forth the gratitude of the receiver, adding,
&ldquo;Let us thank Him for them, and still more in that He has made us
reasonable beings, gifting us with faith, and not brutes or
unbelievers. If we turn to Him in this spirit, He will abide with us as
with them of Cana in Galilee. Therefore, let all anger and malice and
evil speaking be put away from us, who have just been standing before
the most holy Sacrament, and let us be united in the bonds of brotherly
love, that His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>Blood may not have been poured out for us in
vain. And to you, dear friends, who have this day been united with the
grace-giving benediction of the Church, I commend this union of heart
and soul most of all, that the new family thus founded in our midst may
help to build up the living edifice of a people praising and serving
God, and that you walk in His way, and bring up children to serve Him
as our forefathers have ever done.&rdquo; There was a good deal more in
the same strain; and this exhortation to holy living, from one of
themselves, is just a type of the intimate way in which religion enters
into the life of the people. His concluding wish for the well-being of
the newly married was followed by a loud &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; from the assembled throng.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After this came a great number more dishes of edibles, but
this time of a lighter kind; among them liver and poultry, but chiefly
fruits and sweets; and among these many confections of curious devices,
mostly with some symbolical meaning. When these were nearly despatched,
wine and brandy were brought out by the host; and by this name you must
understand the master of the inn; for, true to the paternal character
of which I have already spoken, it is always his business to cater for
and preside over bridal banquets. At the same time the guests produced
their presents, which go by the name of <i lang="de">Waisat</i>, and
all were set down in a circumstantial catalogue. They are generally
meted out with an open hand, and are a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>great help to the
young people in beginning their housekeeping.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The musicians, who only got hasty snatches of the good things
passing round, now began yet livelier strains, and the party broke up
that the younger members might give themselves to their favourite
pastime, dancing; and well enough they looked, the lads in brilliant
red double-breasted waistcoats, their short black leather breeches held
up with embroidered belts, and their well-formed high-pointed hats with
jaunty brim, going through the intricate evolutions, each beating the
time heartily, first on his thighs and then on his feet&mdash;<i lang=
"de">schuhplatteln</i> they call it&mdash;and followed through the mazy
figures by his <i lang="de">diandl</i> (damsel), in daintily fitting
satin bodice, and short but ample skirt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The older people still lingered over the table, and looked on
at the dance, which they follow with great interest; but there is not a
great deal of drinking, and it is seldom enough, even in the midst of
an occasion for such exceptional good cheer, that any excess is
committed. A taste for brandy&mdash;the poor brandy of their own
manufacture&mdash;is however, I confess, a weakness of the
Zillerthalers. The necessity for occasionally having recourse to
stimulants results from the severity of the climate during part of the
year, and the frequently long exposure to the mountain air which their
calling requires of them. At the same time, anything like a confirmed
drunkard is scarcely known among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108"
href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>them. Its manufacture affords
to many an occupation; and its use to all, of both sexes, is a national
habit. They make it out of barley, juniper, and numbers of other
berries (which they wander collecting over all the neighbouring alps),
as well as rye, potatoes, and other roots&mdash;in fact, almost
anything. Every commercial bargain, every operation in the field, every
neighbourly discussion, every declaration of affection even, is made
under its afflatus. An offer of a glass of the cordial will often make
up a long-harboured quarrel, a refusal to share one is taken to be a
studied affront; in fact, this <i lang="de">zutrinken</i>, as they call
it, comes into every act and relation of life. In the moderate bounds
within which they keep its use, it is undeniably a great boon to them;
and many a time it has been the saving of life in the mountains to the
shepherd and the milk-maid, the snow-bound labourer or retarded
pedlar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was curious to know what customs the other valley had to replace
those of the Ziller. My friend informed me they were very similar, only
the Zillerthalers were celebrated for their attachment to and punctual
observance of them. He had once attended a wedding in the
Gr&ouml;dnerthal which was very similar to the one he had already
described, yet had some distinct peculiarities. Though a little out of
place, I may as well bring in his account of it here. There, the
betrothal is called <i lang="de">der Handschlag</i> (<i>lit.</i> the
hand-clasp), and it is always performed on a Saturday. The fathers of
the bride and bridegroom and other nearest relations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>are
always present as witnesses; and if the bride does not cry at the
projected parting, it is said she will have many tears to shed during
her married life. The first time the banns are asked it is not
considered &lsquo;the thing&rsquo; for the betrothed to be present, and
they usually go to church on that occasion in some neighbouring
village; on the second Sunday they are expected to appear in state, the
bridegroom wearing his holiday clothes and a nosegay in his hat or on
his right breast. The bride always wears the local costume, a broadish
brimmed green hat, a scarlet boddice and full black skirt, though this
is now only worn on such occasions; on the day of the wedding, to this
is added a broad black satin ribbon round her head, and round her waist
a leather girdle with a number of useful articles in plated copper
hanging from it. On each side are arranged red and green streamers with
very great nicety, and no change of fashion is suffered in their
position; she is expected to wear a grave mien and modest deportment;
this is particularly enjoined. The guests are also expected to don the
popular costume; the girls green, the married women black hats. On the
way to the church the bridegroom&rsquo;s father and his nearest
neighbour came forward, and with many ceremonies asked the bride of her
friends, and she went crying coyly with them. After the church
ceremony, which concludes as in Zillerthal with the cup of S.
Johannessegen, the bridesmaids hand in a basket decked with knots of
ribbon, containing offerings for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>priests and servers,
and a wreath, which is fastened round the priest&rsquo;s arm who leads
the bride out of church. The visit to the neighbouring inn follows; but
at the wedding feast guests come in in masquerading dresses bringing
all manner of comical presents. The dance here lasts till midnight,
when the happy pair are led home by their friends to an accompaniment
of music, for which they have a special melody. The next day again
there are games, and the newly married go in procession with their
friends to bear home the trousseau and wedding gifts, among which is
always a bed and bedding. On their way back beggars are allowed to bar
the way at intervals, who must be bought off with alms. On the Sunday
following the bride is expected again to appear at church in the local
costume, and in the afternoon all the guests of the wedding day again
gather in the inn to present their final offering of good wishes and
blessings. Girls who are fond of cats, they say, are sure to marry
early; perhaps an evidence that household virtues are appreciated in
them by the men; but of men, the contrary is predicated, showing that
the other sex is expected to display hardihood in the various
mountaineering and other out-door occupations.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Kundl, whither we were bound before being <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>tempted to make this digression, gives entrance
to the Wildsch&ouml;nau according to modern orthography, the <i lang=
"de">Witschnau</i>, or <i lang="de">Wiltschnau</i>, according to local
and more correct pronunciation (sometimes corrupted into Mitschnau), as
the name is derived from <i lang="de">wiltschen</i>, to flow, and
<i>au</i>, water, the particular water in this case being the
Kundler-Ache, which here flows into the Inn. It is a little valley
improving in beauty as you pursue it eastwards, not more than seven
leagues in length, and seldom visited, for its roads are really only
fit for pedestrians; hence its secluded inhabitants have acquired a
character for being suspicious of strangers, though proverbially
hospitable to one another. One of its points of greatest interest is
the church of St. Leonhard, described in the last chapter. Overhanging
the road leading from it to Kundl, stand the remains of the castle of
Niederaich, now converted into a farm stable, and its moat serving as a
conduit of water for the cattle. At the time it was built by Ambrose
Blank in the sixteenth century, the silver mines then in work made this
a most flourishing locality. At that time, too, there stood overlooking
the town the Kundlburg, of which still slighter traces remain, the
residence of the Kummerspruggers, who, in the various wars, always
supported the house of Bavaria. The chief industry of Kundl at present
is the construction of the boats which navigate the Inn, and carry the
rich produce of the Tirolean pastures to Vienna. Oberau is situated on
a commanding <i>plateau</i>, and its unpretending inn &lsquo;<i lang=
"de">auf <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>dem Keller</i>,&rsquo; offers a good
resting-place. The church was burnt down in 1719, and the present one,
remarkable for its size if for nothing else, was completed just a
hundred years ago. It is, however, remarkable also for its
altar-piece&mdash;the Blessed Virgin between S. Barbara and S.
Margaret&mdash;by a local artist, and far above what might be expected
in so sequestered a situation. At a distance of three or four miles,
Niederau is reached, passing first a sulphur spring, esteemed by the
peasants of the neighbourhood. The openest and most smiling&mdash;most
<i>friendly</i>, to use the German expression&mdash;part of the valley
is between Auffach and Kelchsau, where is situated Kobach, near which
may be seen lateral shafts of the old mines extending to a distance of
many hundred feet. From Kelchsau a foot-path leads in an hour more to
H&ouml;rbrunn, where there is a brisk little establishment of
glass-works, whose productions go all over Tirol. Then westwards over
the Plaknerjoch to Altbach, passing Thierberg (not the same as that
mentioned near Kufstein), once the chief seat of the silver-works, its
only remaining attraction being the beautiful view to be obtained from
its heights over the banks of the Inn, and the whole extent of country
between it and Bavaria. From Altbach it is an hour more back to
Brixlegg.</p>
<p>The memory of the former metallic wealth of the valley is preserved
in numerous tales of sudden riches overtaking the people in all manner
of different ways, as in the specimens already given. Here is a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>similar one belonging to this spot. A peasant
going out with his waggon found one day in the way a heap of fine white
wheat. Shocked that God&rsquo;s precious gift should be trodden under
foot, he stopped his team and gathered up the grain, of which there was
more than enough to fill all his pockets; when he arrived at his
destination, he found them full of glittering pieces of money. The
origin of the story doubtless may be traced to some lucky take of ore
which the finder was able to sell at the market town; and the price
which he brought home was spoken of as the actual article discovered.
Another relic of the mining works may perhaps be found in the following
instance of another class of stories, though some very like it
doubtless refer to an earlier belief in hobgoblins closely allied to
our own Robin Goodfellow. I think a large number date from occasions
when the <i lang="de">Knappen</i> or miners, who formed a tribe apart,
may have come to the aid of the country people when in difficulty.</p>
<p>The Unterhausberg family was once powerful in Wiltschnau. When their
mighty house was building, the great foundation-stone was so ponderous
that it defied all the efforts of the builders to put it in its place.
At last they sat down to dinner; then there suddenly came out of the
mountain side a number of Wiltschnau dwarfs, who, without any effort,
lowered the great stone into its appointed place; the men offered them
the best portion of their dinner, but they refused any reward. The
dwarfs were not always so urbane, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"
href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>however, and there are many
stories of their tricks: lying down in the pathways in the dark to make
the people tumble over them; then hiding behind a tree, and with loud
laughter mocking the disaster;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2598src"
href="#xd21e2598" name="xd21e2598src">7</a> throwing handfuls of
pebbles and ashes at the peasant girls as they passed; getting into the
store-room, and mixing together the potatoes, carrots, grain, and
flour, which the housewife had carefully assorted and arranged. It was
particularly on women that their tricks were played off; and this to
such an extent that it became the custom, even now prevailing, never to
send women to the Hochalm with the herds, though they go out into other
equally remote mountain districts without fear, for their <i lang=
"de">Kasa</i> (the hut for shelter at night, here so called, in other
parts <i lang="de">Sennh&uuml;tte</i>,) was sure to be beset with the
dwarfs, and their milk-pails overturned. All these feats may, I think,
be ascribed in their origin to the <i lang="de">Knappen</i>.</p>
<p>The neighbourhood of Thierberg has a story which I think also has
its source in mining memories. &lsquo;On the way between Altbach and
Thierbach you pass two houses bearing the name of &ldquo;<i lang=
"de">beim Thaler</i>.&rdquo; In olden time there lived here a peasant
of moderate means, who owned several head of cattle; Moidl, the maid,
whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>duty it was to take them out to pasture on the
sunny hill-side, always looked out anxiously for the first tokens of
spring; for she loved better to watch the cows and goats browsing the
fresh grass, or venturously climbing the heights, to sitting in the
chimney-corner dozing over the spinning-wheel. One day as she was at
her favourite occupation, she heard a noise behind her, and turning
round saw a door open in the mountain side, and two or three little men
with long beards peeping out. Within, all was dazzling with gold like
the brightest sunshine. The walls were covered with plates of gold,
placed one over the other like scales, and knobs of gold like
pine-apples studded the vault. The little men beckoned to Moidl to come
in, but she, like a modest maiden, ran home to her father; when he
returned with her, however, to the spot, the door was no more to be
found.&rsquo; I think it may very well be imagined that Moidl came
unawares upon the opening of a lateral shaft, and listened to the
accounts which the Knappen may have amused themselves with giving her
of the riches of their diggings; while she may very naturally have been
afraid to explore these. The disappearance of the mysterious opening is
but the ordinary <i>refrain</i> of marvellous tales.</p>
<p>The Witschnauers cannot be accused of any dreamy longings after the
recurrence of such prosperous times. They are among the most diligent
tillers of the land to be found anywhere; the plough is carried over
places where the uneven gradients make the guiding of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>horses or oxen a too great expenditure of time;
in such places they do not disdain to harness themselves to the plough,
and even the women take their turn in relieving them. Of one husbandman
of olden time it is narrated that he was even <i>too</i> eager in his
thrift, and carried his furrow a little way on to his neighbour&rsquo;s
land year by year, so that by the time he came to die he had
appropriated a good strip of land not his own. His penance was, that
after death he should continually tread up and down the stolen soil,
dragging after him a red-hot ploughshare, in performing which his wail
was often overhead&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">Another class of legends has also a home in this
locality. It is told that a peasant from Oberau was going home from
Thierbach, one Epiphany Eve. It was a cold night; his feet crunched the
crisp snow at every step; the air was clear, and the stars shone
brightly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>The peasant&rsquo;s head, however, was not so
clear as the sky, for he came from the tavern, where he had been
spending a merry evening with his boon companions. Thus it happened
that instead of walking straight on, he gave one backward step for
every three forward, like the <i lang="de">Umgehende
Schuster</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2675src" href="#xd21e2675"
name="xd21e2675src">10</a> and thus he went staggering about till he
came to the <i lang="de">Rastbank</i>, which is even yet sought as a
point where to rest and overlook the view. It struck twelve as he
seated himself on the bench; then suddenly behind him he heard a sound
of many voices, which came on nearer and nearer, and then the <i lang=
"de">Berchtl</i> in her white clothing, her broken ploughshare in her
hand, and all her train of little people<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2691src" href="#xd21e2691" name="xd21e2691src">11</a> swept
clattering and chattering close past him. The least was the last, and
it wore a long shirt which got in the way of its little bare feet, and
kept tripping it up. The peasant had sense enough left to feel
compassion, so he took his garter off and bound it for a girdle round
the infant, and then set it again on its way. When the Berchtl saw what
he had done, she turned back and thanked him, and told him that in
return for his compassion his children should never come to want. This
story, I think there is little doubt, may be genuine; your
Wiltschenauer is as fond of brandy as your Zillerthaler, and under its
influence the peasant may very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118"
href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>likely have passed a troubled
night on the Rastbank. What more likely to cross his fancy on the
Epiphany Eve than the thought of a visit from the Berchtl and her
children (they always appear in Tirol at that season, and in rags and
tatters<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2699src" href="#xd21e2699" name=
"xd21e2699src">12</a>); his own temperament being compassionate, that
he should help the stumbling little one, and that the Berchtl should
give him promise of reward was all that might be expected from certain
premises. But what are those premises? Who was the Berchtl? If you ask
a Tirolean peasant the question, he will probably tell you that the
<i lang="de">Perchtl</i> (as he will call her) is Pontius
Pilate&rsquo;s wife,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2705src" href=
"#xd21e2705" name="xd21e2705src">13</a> to whom redemption was given by
reason of her intervention in favour of the Man of Sorrows, but that it
is her penance to wander over the earth till the last day as a restless
spirit; and that as the Epiphany was the season of favour to the
Gentiles, among whose first-fruits she was, it is at that season she is
most often seen, and in her most favourable mood. It must be confessed
that some of his stories of her will betray a certain amount of
inconsistency, for he will represent her carrying off children,
wounding belated passengers, and performing many acts inconsistent with
the character of a penitent soul, and more in accordance with that of
the more ancient &lsquo;Lamia.&rsquo;</p>

use of the name <i>Allfadir</i>, whom they had invoked in the prayers
of their childhood, when praying to Him who is &ldquo;our Father in
heaven.&rdquo;&rsquo; And as with the greater, so with the less, the
mighty powers they had personified and treated as heroes and examples
lived on in their imagination, and their glorious deeds came to be
ascribed to the new athletes of a brighter faith. Then, &lsquo;although
originally popular tales were reproductions of more ancient legends,
yet after a time a general taste was created for marvellous stories,
and new ones were invented in large numbers. Even in these purely
imaginative productions, analogies may be discovered with more genuine
tales, because they were made after the original patterns, and in many
cases were mere variations on an ancient air.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2783src" href="#xd21e2783" name="xd21e2783src">22</a> More
than this, there came the actual accession of marvels derived from the
acts inspired by the new faith; but it cannot be denied that the two
became strangely blended in the popular mind.</p>

<p>Brixlegg presents some appearance of thriving, through the smelting
and wire-drawing works for the copper ore brought from the
neighbourhood of Schwatz. It also enjoys some celebrity as the
birthplace of the Tirolean historian Burgleckner, whose family had been
respected here for generations; and it is very possible to put up for
the night at the <i lang="de">Herrenhaus</i>. It is not much above a
mile hence to Rattenberg, of which I have already spoken. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>Rattenberg was, in 1651, the scene of a tragic event, sad as the
denouement of many a fiction. The high-spirited consort of Archduke
Leopold V., Claudia de&rsquo; Medici, who, at his death, governed the
country so well, and by her sagacity kept her dominions at peace, while
the rest of Germany was immersed in the horrors of the Thirty
Years&rsquo; War, yet did not altogether escape the charge of
occasional harshness in collecting the revenues which she knew so well
how to administer. Her chancellor, Wilhelm Biener, a trusty and devoted
servant and counsellor, drew on himself considerable odium for his zeal
in these matters. On one occasion he got into a serious controversy
with Crosini, Bishop of Brixen, concerning the payment of certain taxes
from which the prelate claimed exemption, and in the course of it wrote
him a letter couched in such very unguarded terms, that the bishop,
unused to be so dealt with, could not forbear exclaiming, &lsquo;The
man deserves to lose the fingers that could write such an intemperate
effusion!&rsquo; The exclamation was not thought of again till years
after.</p>
<p>Claudia died in 1648, and then the hatred against Biener, which was
also in some measure a hatred of races, for Claudia had many
southerners at her court, broke forth without hindrance. He was
accused<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2801src" href="#xd21e2801" name=
"xd21e2801src">23</a> of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href=
"#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>appropriating the State money he
had been so earnest in collecting, and though tried by two Italian
judges, he was ultimately condemned, in 1651, to lose his head. Biener
sent a statement of his case to the Archduke Ferdinand Karl; and the
young prince, believing the honesty of his mother&rsquo;s faithful
adviser, immediately ordered a reprieve. The worst enemy and prime
accuser of the fallen favourite was Schmaus, President of the Council,
this time a German, and he contrived by detaining the messenger to make
him arrive just too late in Rattenberg, then still a strong fortress,
where he lay confined, and where the sentence was to be carried
out.</p>
<p>Biener had all along steadfastly maintained his innocence; and
stepping on to the scaffold, he had again repeated the assertion,
adding, &lsquo;So truly as I am innocent, I summon my accuser before
the Judgment-seat above before another year is out.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2808src" href="#xd21e2808" name=
"xd21e2808src">24</a> When the executioner stooped to lift up the head
before the people, he found lying by its side three fingers of his
right hand, without having had any knowledge that he had struck them
off, though he might have done so by the unhappy man having raised his
hand in the way of the sword in the last struggle. The people, however,
saw in it the <span class="corr" id="xd21e2811" title=
"Source: fulfilment">fulfillment</span> of the words of the bishop, as
well as a ghastly challenge accompanying his dying message to President
Schmaus. Nor did they forget to note that the latter died of a terrible
malady some months before the close <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>of the year.
Biener&rsquo;s wife lost her senses when she knew the terrible
circumstances of his death; the consolations of her director and of her
son, who lived to his ninetieth year in the Francescan convent at
Innsbruck, were alike powerless to calm her. She escaped in the night,
and wandered out into the mountains no one knows whither. But the
people say she lives on to be a witness of her husband&rsquo;s
innocence, and may be met on lonely ways proclaiming it, but never
harming any. Only, when anyone is to die in
B&uuml;chsenhausen,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2816src" href=
"#xd21e2816" name="xd21e2816src">25</a> where her married life passed
so pleasantly, the &lsquo;Bienerweible&rsquo; will appear and warn
them. It is a remarkable instance of the easy way in which one myth
passes into another, that though this event happened but a little over
two hundred years ago, the Bienerweible and the Berchtl are already
confounded in the popular mind.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2819src"

<p>Another name prized in Tirolese annals, which must not be forgotten
in connexion with Rattenberg, is Alois Sandbichler, the Bible
commentator, who was born there in 1751. He passed a brilliant career
as Professor in the University of Salzburg, but died at the age of
eighty in his native village.</p>
<p>The neighbourhood of Brixlegg is very pretty, and the views from the
bridge by no means to be overlooked. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have hitherto been occupied almost exclusively with
the right bank of the Inn. We will now return to Jenbach, as a
starting-point for the beauties of the left bank.</p>
<p>Near the station of Jenbach is a &lsquo;<i lang=
"de">Restauration</i>,&rsquo; which bears the singular title of
&lsquo;<i lang="de">zum Tolerantz</i>.&rsquo; In the town, which is at
some little distance on the K&auml;sbach stream, the &lsquo;Post&rsquo;
affords very decent accommodation; The dining-room of the more
primitive &lsquo;Brau&rsquo; is a neat building in the Swiss style, and
commands a prospect which might more than compensate for even worse
fare than it affords. Jenbach had its name from being situated on the
further side of the Inn from that on which the old post-road had been
carried. There are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span>extensive iron-foundries and breweries,
which give the place a busy aspect, and an air of prosperity.</p>
<p>The excursions from Jenbach are countless. Between the stations of
Brixlegg and Jenbach lie only M&uuml;nster and Wiesing, with nothing
remarkable, except that the church of Wiesing, having been struck by
lightning in 1782, was rebuilt with stones taken from the neighbouring
Pulverthurm, built by the Emperor Maximilian, in 1504, but destroyed by
lightning at the same time as the church. Count Tannenberg&rsquo;s park
(<i lang="de">Thiergarten</i>), near here, is a most curious enclosure
of natural rock, aided by masonry, and stocked with deer, fish, and
fowl. Then Kramsach, and in the woods near it the Hilariusbergl, once
inhabited by two hermits, and still held sacred: also the strangely
wild Rettengsch&ouml;ss and its marbles; and several remarkable Alpine
peaks, particularly the Zireinalpe and its little lake, bearing a
memory of Seirens in its traditions as well as in its name. Here
another river Ache runs into the Inn, distinguished from that on the
opposite side, as the Brandenberger Ache. At its debouche stands
Voldepp, whence the Mariathal and the Mooserthal may be visited, and
&lsquo;the neighbourhood is rich in marbles used in the churches of
Innsbruck.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2879src" href="#xd21e2879"
name="xd21e2879src">1</a> The Mooserthal is remarkable for three small
lakes, which can be formed and let off at pleasure; they are the
property of the Barons of Lichtenthurm, who fatten <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>carp
in them. The lowest of the three, the Rheinthalersee, has the prettiest
surroundings. Weber says they are all fed by subterranean currents from
the mountains. Ball (&lsquo;Central Alps&rsquo;) treats them as
overflowings of the Inn.</p>
<p>The most flourishing town of the Mariathal is Achenrain, where there
are extensive brass-works. Mass is said for the out-lying operatives in
the Castle-chapel of Lichtenthurm. The village of Mariathal is very
snugly situated, almost hidden by its woods from the road. Its chief
feature is the deserted convent of Dominicanesses founded in the
thirteenth century by Ulrich and Konrad v. Freundsberg; their
descendant, Georg v. Freundsberg, celebrated in the Thirty Years&rsquo;
War, whom we learn more about when we come to Schwatz, also endowed the
nuns liberally, bidding them pray for him; his effigy may still be seen
in the church of Mariathal; and the convent, even in its present
condition, is a favourite pilgrimage. Hence a rocky defile of wild and
varied beauty, and many miles in length, leads into the
Brandenbergerthal, which reaches to the Bavarian frontier. Its highest
point is the Steinberg, to be recognized in the distance by its
pyramidal form, which is situated within what the Germans graphically
term a <i>cauldron</i> (Gebirgskessel) of mountains, and is shut off
from all communication with the outer world by the snow during the
winter months. The Brandenbergers have been famous for their patriotism
and defence of their independence during <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>all the various
conflicts with Bavaria, and they love to call their native soil the
<i lang="de">Heimaththal</i> and the <i lang="de">Freiheitthal</i>. The
only tale of the supernatural I have met with as connected with this
locality is the following; it has a certain wild grasp, but its moral
is not easy to trace; it is analogous, however, to many traditions of
other places.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of the Jochs surrounding the Brandenbergerthal was
celebrated for its rich grasses; on its &ldquo;alm&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2899src" href="#xd21e2899" name="xd21e2899src">2</a>
the cattle often found pasturage even late in the winter. The <i lang=
"de">Senner</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2904src" href="#xd21e2904"
name="xd21e2904src">3</a> here watching his flocks was visited one
Christmas Eve by an old man in thick winter clothing, with a mighty
pine-staff in his hand; he begged the <i lang="de">Senner</i> on the
coming night to heat his hut as hot as ever he could, assuring him he
would have no cause to regret his compliance. The <i lang=
"de">Senner</i> thought it was a strange adventure, but congratulated
himself that it might be the means of propitiating the goblins, of
whose pranks in the winter nights he was not without his fears. So he
heaped log upon log all day, till the hut was so hot he could hardly
bear it. Then he crept under a bench in the corner where a little chink
gave a breath from the outer air, and waited to see what would come to
pass. Towards midnight he heard steps approaching nearer and nearer,
and then there was a sound of heavy boots stamping off the snow.
Immediately after, seven men stepped <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>into the room in
silence. Their boots and clothes were all frozen as hard as if they had
been carved out of ice, and their very presence served to cool down the
air of the hut to such an extent that the <i lang="de">Senner</i> was
now obliged to rub his hands. When they had stood a considerable space
round the fire without uttering a word, they all seven left the hut as
silently and solemnly as they had entered it. The <i lang=
"de">Senner</i> now crawled out of his hiding-place, and a loud cry of
joy burst spontaneously from his lips, for his hat, which he had left
on the table, was full of bright shining golden <i lang=
"de">zwanzigers</i>. These seven,<a id="xd21e2925" name=
"xd21e2925"></a> the legend goes on to say, &lsquo;were never seen but
this once. They were the seven <i lang="de">Goldherds</i> of the
<i lang="de">Reiche Spitze</i> (on the Salzburg frontier); for up there
there are exhaustless treasures, but whatever a mortal takes of them
during life, he must suffer <i>the Cold Torment</i> and keep watch over
it after death; and of such there have been seven in the course of the
world&rsquo;s ages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With regard to &lsquo;the Cold Torment,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2939src" href="#xd21e2939" name="xd21e2939src">4</a> they have
the following legend in the neighbourhood of Innsbruck:&mdash;There was
once a peasant who had been very unlucky, and got so deep in debt that
he saw no way of extricating himself. Unable to bear the sight of his
starving family, he wandered out into the forest, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>until at last he met a strange-looking man in
the old Frankish costume, who came up to him and said, &lsquo;You are
poor indeed, and know no means of help.&rsquo; &lsquo;Most true,&rsquo;
replied the peasant; &lsquo;of money and good counsel I can use more
than you can have to bestow.&rsquo; &lsquo;I will help you,&rsquo; said
the strange-looking man; &lsquo;I will give you as much money as you
can use while you live, and all you have to do for it will be to bear
<i>the Cold Torment</i> for me after you die; nothing but that, only
just to feel rather too cold, and all that time hence&mdash;what does
it matter?&rsquo; The peasant retraced his steps, and as he drew near
home his children came out to meet him with their pinafores full of
gold, and all about the house there were heaps of gold, more than he
could use; and he lived a merry life till the time came for him to die.
Then he remembered what was before him; so he called his wife to him,
and got her to make him a whole suit of the thickest rough woollen
cloth, and stockings, hood, and gloves of the same. In the night,
before they had buried him, his boys saw him, just as the De profundis
bell rang, get up from the bed in all this warm clothing, and shut the
gate behind him, and go out into the forest to deliver the spirit which

<p>To the north-east of this valley, and still on the left bank of the
Inn, is the favourite pilgrimage of Maria-Stein. I have not learnt its
origin, but there is a tradition that, in 1587, Baron Schurff, to whom
the neighbouring Castle of Stein then belonged, being desirous to take
the precious likeness of the Blessed Virgin honoured there to his
Bavarian dwelling, thrice attempted the removal, and on each occasion
it was found by the next morning restored to its original sanctuary,
which is in a chapel at the top of a high tower. The castle was a
dependency of the Freundsbergers of Schwatz, till the family died out.
It was subsequently bestowed by the Archduke Sigismund on one of his
supporters, to whom he gave also the title of Baron Schurff. Afterwards
it came into possession of Count Paris von Klotz, who gave it to form a
presbytery and school for which it is still used. Among its
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>treasures was a Slave codex of Homilies of the
early fathers; Count Klotz had a reprint made from it at Vienna. A
little lake (Maria Steinersee) at no great distance affords excellent
fish called <i lang="de">Nasen</i>, whence the neighbouring dale is
called Nasenthal; and from several points there are most enjoyable
views of the <i lang="de">h&ouml;he Salve</i> and the little towns of
W&ouml;rgl, Kirchb&uuml;hel, and H&auml;ring across the river.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Jenbach affords also numerous mountain walks through the Achenthal:
a favourite one is over the Mauriz Alp, to Maurach, which has many
points of interest to the geologist. For those who are not fond of
pedestrianism, there is a splendid drive along the road&mdash;one of
the old highways to Bavaria and the north of Europe. An accident is of
very rare occurrence; but some parts of it are rather frightful. For
those whose nerves are proof against the fears suggested here and
there, there is immense enjoyment to be found, as it winds its way
along the romantic woody K&auml;sbachthal, round&mdash;indeed
through&mdash;the wild and overhanging rocks, or, supported on piles,
runs close along the edge of the intensely blue Achen lake, under the
over-arching Spiel-joch, steep as a wall. The first place to halt at is
Skolastica, where there is a pretty, much-frequented swimming-school;
and whence even ladies have ascended the Unnutzjoch over the K&ouml;gl.
It is often crowded in the season, as also are all the little towns
round the lake&mdash;Achenthal, Pertisau, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>Buchau. Several
excellent varieties of fish, which are the property of the Monastery of
Viecht, and the pleasure-fares across the waters, afford means of
subsistence to a little population of boatmen, who have made their
nests on the rocks wherever there is a foot of level ground. Pertisau,
however, is on a green smiling spot, and is a relief to the majestic
wildness of the rest of the surrounding scenery. A very extraordinary
effect may be observed at a short distance out from Buchau. The
mountain outline on the right hand appears to be that of a regular
fortress, with all professional accessories, bidding defiance to the
neighbourhood: it is only as the boat approaches quite near, that you
see it is only one of those <i lang="fr">tours de force</i> with which
nature often surprises us; as, for example, in the portrait of Louis
XVI. in the outline of the Traunstein, seen from Baura.</p>
<p>From the village of Achenthal the road runs, through the Bavarian
frontier, to the well-known baths and Bavarian royal <i lang=
"de">Lustschloss</i>&mdash;until 1803 a Benedictine monastery&mdash;of
Tegernsee, through <i lang="de">Pass-Achen</i>, celebrated in the
patriotic struggles of 1809.</p>
<p>The Achensee is the largest and one of the most beautiful lakes of
Tirol. It is fed partly by mountain streams, and partly by subterranean
springs. The people tell a warning tale of its first rising. They say
that in olden times there was a stately and prosperous town on what is
now the bed of the lake; but the inhabitants in their prosperity forgot
God so far, that the young lads played at skittles along the aisles of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>church, even while the sacred office was being
sung, and the Word of God preached. A day came; it was a great feast,
but they drove their profane sport as usual, and no one said them
nay;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3016src" href="#xd21e3016" name=
"xd21e3016src">6</a> and so a great flood rose up through the floor;
rose above their heads; above the church roof; above the church
steeple; and they say that even now, on a bright calm day, you may see
the gilt ball of the steeple shining under the waters, and in the still
moonshine you may hear the bell ring out the midnight hour. There are
many other tales of such swift and righteous judgments lingering in
Tirol.</p>
<p>The lower eastern ridge of the Harlesanger or Hornanger Alpe, is, on
account of its stern and barren character, called the Wildenfeld. This
is how it received its name. Ages ago, it was a very paradise of beauty
and fruitfulness. All the choicest Alpine grasses grew <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>there in abundance; but with these riches and
plenty the pride of the Senners and milkers waxed great too; and as a
token of their reckless wastefulness, it is recorded that they used
rich cheeses for paving-stones and skittles. One ancient Senner, like
another Lot, raised his feeble but indignant voice against them, but
they heeded him not. One day, as he mused over the sins of his people,
a bright bird, with a plumage such as he had never seen before,
fluttered round him, warbling, &lsquo;Righteous man, get thee hence!
righteous man, get thee hence!&rsquo; The old man saw the finger of
God, and immediately followed the guiding flight of the bird to a place
of safety, while a great peak from the Harlesanger fell over the too
prosperous <i>Joch</i>, buried its impious inhabitants, and spread
desolation all around. There is now a pilgrimage chapel.</p>
<p>Another excursion, which must not be omitted, from Jenbach, is that
to Eben, which lies a little off the high road, at some elevation, but
in the midst of a delightful table-land (hence its name) of most
fruitful character. As the burial-place of St. Nothburga, it is still a
spot of great resort. Unhappily, not all those buried here were so holy
as the peasant saint. A tradition is preserved of one wicked above
others, though he seemed all fair to the outward eye, and the Church
consequently admitted him to lie in holy ground. But he felt the Eye of
One above upon him, and he could not rest; and in his struggles to
withdraw himself from that all-searching gaze, he bored and bored on
through the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>consecrated earth, till he had worked his way
out into the common soil beyond. A horse-shoe, deeply graven in the
&lsquo;Friedhof&rsquo; boundary, and which no one has ever been able to
wall up, marks the spot by which he passed; and the people call it the
&lsquo;Escape of the Vampire.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3036src" href="#xd21e3036" name="xd21e3036src">7</a></p>
<p>The unpretending village of Stans, situated in the midst of a very
forest of fruit-trees, at no great distance from Jenbach, is the
birth-place of Joseph Arnold, one of the religious artists, of whom
Tirol has produced so many. Without winning, of some it may be said
without meriting perhaps, much fame for themselves in the world,
without attaining the honour of founding a school, they have laboured
painstakingly and successfully to adorn their village temples, and keep
alive the faith and devotion of their countrymen. Almost where-ever you
go in Tirol you find praiseworthy copies of paintings, whose titles are
connected with the celebrated shrines of Italy, modestly reproduced by
them, or some fervent attempt at an original rendering of a sacred
subject, by men who never aspired that their names should reach beyond
the echoes of their own beloved mountains. The prior of Viecht,
Eberhard Zobel, discovered the merits of Joseph Arnold and drew him
from obscurity, or rather from one degree of obscurity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>to
another less profound, had him instructed according to the best means
within his attainment, and gave him occupation in the monastery. His
homely aspirations made him content with the sphere to which he was
native, and he never went far from it. The altarpiece in the church of
Stans, representing St. Lawrence and St. Ulric, is his work and his
gift.</p>
<p>From Stans there is a path through the grand scenery of the
Stallenthal, leading to the shrine of St. Georgenberg. For a time the
pretty villages of the Innthal are lost to sight, and you pass a
country known only to the wild game, the hunter, and the pilgrim; the
bare rocky precipices relieved only here and there with woods, while
the Stallen torrents run noisily below. Who could pass through such a
neighbourhood and not think of the crowds of pilgrims who, through ages
past, have approached the sacred spot in a spirit of faith and
submission, bearing their sins and their sorrows, the burden of their
afflictions, moral and physical, and have gone down to their homes
comforted?</p>
<p>A wonderful shrine it is: a rock which might seem marked out
&lsquo;from the beginning&rsquo; to be a shrine; shut out by Nature
from earthly communication; piercing the very sky. You stand beneath it
and long for an eagle&rsquo;s wings to bear you aloft: there seems no
other means of access. Then a weary winding path is shown you, up
which, with many sloping returns upon your former level, and crossing
the roaring stream at a giddy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138"
href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>height, you at last reach an
<i lang="de">Absatzbr&uuml;cke</i>&mdash;a bridge or viaduct&mdash;over
the chasm, uniting the height you have been climbing, with the cliff of
S. George. It is a long bridge, and only made of wood; and you fancy it
trembles beneath your anxious tread, as you span the seemingly
unfathomable abyss. A modest cross, which you cannot fail to observe at
its head, records the marvellous preservation of a girl of twenty-one,
named Monica Ragel, a farm-servant, who one fine morning in April 1831,
in her zeal to gather the fairest flowers for the wreath she was
weaving for the Madonna&rsquo;s altar, attempted to climb the
treacherous steep, and losing her footing slipped down the cliff, a
distance of one hundred and forty feet. The neighbours crowded to the
spot, with all the haste the dangerous footing would admit, and though
they had no hope of finding her alive. She was so far uninjured,
however, that she was able to resume work within the week.</p>
<p>The buildings found perched at this height cannot fail to convey a
striking impression; and this still more do the earnest penitents, who
may nearly always be found kneeling within. First, you come upon the
little chapel of the &lsquo;<i lang="de">Schmerzhaften
Mutter</i>,&rsquo; with a little garden of graves of those who have
longed to lie in death as they dwelt in life&mdash;near the shrine;
among them is that of the Benedictine Magnus Dagn, whose knowledge of
music is referred to in the following simple epitaph, &lsquo;<i lang=
"la">Magnus nomine, major arte, maximus virtute</i>.&rsquo; Opposite it
is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>the principal church, containing in one of its
chapels one of those most strange of relics, which here and there have
come down to us with their legends from &lsquo;the ages of
faith.&rsquo; In the year 1310, when Rupert I. was the fourteenth abbot
of St. Georgenberg, a priest of the order<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3068src" href="#xd21e3068" name="xd21e3068src">8</a> was saying
Mass in this very chapel. Just at the moment of the consecration of the
chalice a doubt started in his mind, whether it were possible that at
his unworthy bidding so great a mystery should be accomplished as the
fulfillment of the high announcement, &lsquo;This is My Blood.&rsquo;
In this condition of mind he concluded the words of consecration; and
behold, immediately, in place of the white wine mingled with water in
the chalice, he saw it fill with red blood, overflowing upon the
corporal; some portion of this was preserved in a vial, set into a
reliquary on the altar. Round the church are the remains of the
original monastery, in which the monks of Veicht generally leave some
of their number to minister both to the spiritual and corporal needs of
pilgrims.</p>
<p>It seems difficult to fix a date for the origin of this pilgrimage,
one of the most ancient of Tirol. There is a record that in 992 a
chapel was consecrated here to our Lady of Sorrows, by Albuin, Bishop
of Brizen; but it was long before this<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3073src" href="#xd21e3073" name="xd21e3073src">9</a> that
Rathold, a young nobleman of Aiblingen in Bavaria, &lsquo;having learnt
the hollowness of the joys his position promised him, made up his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>mind to forsake all, and live in the wilderness
to God alone.&rsquo; He wandered on, shunning the smooth and verdant
plains of his native lands, and the smiling fruitful amenities of the
Innthal, till at last he found himself surrounded by wild solitudes in
the valley of the Stallen; plunging into its depths, his eye alighted
on the almost inaccessible Lampsenjock. Then choosing for his dwelling
a peak, on which a few limes had found a ledge and sown themselves, he
cut a little cave for his shelter in the rock beneath them, and there
he lived and prayed. But after a time a desire came over him to visit
the shrines of the mightiest saints; so he took up his pilgrim staff
once more, and sped over the mountains and over the plains, till he had
knelt at the <i lang="la">limine Apostolorum</i>, and pressed his lips
upon the soil, fragrant with the martyr&rsquo;s blood. Nor was his zeal
yet satisfied. There was another Apostle the fame of whose shrine was
great; and &lsquo;a year and a day&rsquo; brought our pilgrim to S.
Iago de Compostella. Then, having thus graduated in the school of the
saints, he came back to his solitude under the lime-trees on the rock,
to practise the lessons of Divine contemplation he had thus imbibed in
the perfume of the holy places.</p>
<p>He did not come back alone. From the great storehouse of Rome he had
brought a treasure of sacred art&mdash;a picture of the Madonna, for
which his own hands wrought a little sanctuary. From far and near pious
people came to venerate the sacred image; and &lsquo;<i lang=
"de">Unsere liebe Frau zur Linde</i>,&rsquo; was the watch-word, at
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3088" title="Not in source">the</span>
sound <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>of which the sick and the oppressed revived with
hope.</p>
<p>One day, it chanced that a young noble, whom ardent love of the
chase had led into this secluded valley, turned aside from following
the wild chamois, to inquire what strange power fascinated the peasants
into attempting yon steep ascent. Curious himself to see the
wonder-working shrine, he scaled the peak, and found to his
astonishment, in the modest guardian of the picture, the elder brother
who long ago had &lsquo;chosen the better part.&rsquo; In token of his
joy at the meeting, he made a vow to build on the spot a chapel, as
well as a place of shelter for the weary pilgrim. His undertaking was
no sooner known than all the people of the neighbouring valleys, nobles
and peasants, applied to have their part in the work. Thus supported,
it was begun in right earnest; but the workmen had no sooner got it
fairly in hand than all the blessing, which for so long had been poured
out on the spot, seemed suddenly to be quenched. Nothing would succeed,
and every attempt was baffled; and one thing, which was more
particularly remarked, was that the men were continually having
accidents, and wounding themselves with their tools. More strange
still, every day two white doves flew down from above, and carefully
picking out every chip and shaving on which blood had fallen, gathered
them in their beaks and flew away. Finding that no progress could be
made with the work, and that this man&oelig;uvre of the doves continued
day by day, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span>pious Reinhold resolved to follow them; and
when he at last succeeded in finding their hiding-place, there lay
before him, neatly fashioned out of the chips which the doves had
carried away, a tiny chapel of perfectly symmetrical form.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3098src" href="#xd21e3098" name=
"xd21e3098src">10</a> The hermit saw in the affair the guiding hand of
God, demanding of him the sacrifice of seven years&rsquo; attachment to
his cell; and cheerfully yielding obedience to the token, requested his
brother that the chapel should be erected on the spot thus pointed out.
Theobald willingly complied, and dedicated it to the patron of
chivalry, St. George. The fame of Reinhold&rsquo;s piety, and of his
wonderful chapel, was bruited far and near; and now, not all who came
to visit him went back to their homes. Many youths of high degree,
fired by the example of the hermit sprung out of their order, applied
to join him in his life of austerity; and soon a whole colony had
established itself, Camaldolese-fashion, in little huts round his.
There seems to have been no lack of zealous followers to sustain the
odour of sanctity of St. Georgenberg; early in the twelfth century, the
Bishop of Brixen put them under the rule of S. Benedict, to whose monks
Tirol, and especially Unterinnthal, already owed so great a debt of
gratitude, for keeping alive the faith. His followers endowed it with
much of the surrounding land, which the brothers, by hard manual
labour, brought into cultivation. They were overtaken by many heavy
trials in the course of centuries: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143"
href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>at one time it was a fire,
driven by the fierce winds, which ravaged their homestead; at another
time, avalanches annihilated the traces of their industry. At last, the
spirit of prudence prevailing on their earlier energetic hardiness, it
was resolved to remove the monastery to Viecht, where the brothers
already had a nucleus in a little hospital for the sick among them, and
where also was the dep&ocirc;t for their cattle-dealing&mdash;a
<i lang="de">Viehzuchthof</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3106src"
href="#xd21e3106" name="xd21e3106src">11</a> whence by corruption it
derived its name.</p>
<p>The execution of this idea was commenced in 1705. The abbot,
Celestin B&ouml;hmen, a native of Vienna, had formerly held a grade of
officer in the Austrian artillery. Nothing could exceed the zeal with
which he took the matter in hand; and plans were laid out for raising
the building on the most extensive and costly scale. So grand an
edifice required large funds; and these were not slow to flow in, for
St. Georgenberg was beloved by all the country round. When he saw the
vast sums in his hand, however, the old spirit of the world, and its
covetousness, crept over him again, and a morning came when, to the
astonishment of the brotherhood, the abbot was nowhere to be
found&mdash;nor the gold! The progress of the work was effectually
arrested for the moment; but zeal overcame even the obstacle presented
by this loss, and by 1750 Abbot Lambert had brought to completion the
present edifice, in late Renaissance style, which, though imposing and
substantial, forms but one wing of Celestin B&ouml;hmen&rsquo;s plan.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>If the spirit of the world came over Abbot Celestin in the cloister,
the spirit of the cloister came back upon him in the world; and it was
not many years before he came back, full of shame and contrition,
making open confession of his fault, and placing himself entirely in
the hands of his former subjects. Though at this time the monks were
yet in the midst of their anxieties for the means for carrying on the
work, they suffered themselves to be ruled by a spirit of Christian
charity, and refused to give him up to the rigour of the law; and he
ended his days with edifying piety at Anras, in the Pusterthal.</p>
<p>A great festival was kept at Viecht, in 1845, in memory of the
consecration, which was attended by sixty thousand persons, from
Bavaria as well as Tirol.</p>
<p>The library contains an interesting collection of MSS. and early
printed books in many languages, and is particularly rich in works
illustrative of Tirolean history. In the church are some of Nissl the
elder&rsquo;s wood-carvings, which are always worth attention. The
confessionals are adorned with figures of celebrated penitents, by his
hand; and other noteworthy works will be found in a series of nine
<i lang="fr">tableaux</i>, showing forth the Passion; also the crucifix
over the high altar, and four life-sized carvings. In all these he was
assisted by his pupils, Franz Thaler, of Jenbach, who afterwards came
to have the charge of the Vienna cabinet of antiquities, and Antony
H&uuml;ber, the most successful of his school. Perhaps the finest
specimen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>of all is a dead Christ, under the altar,
remarkable for the anatomical knowledge displayed. Like many another
mountain sanctuary isolated and exposed to the wind, this monastery has
more than once been ravaged by fire; in 1868 it was in great part burnt
down, and the church-building zeal of Tirol is still being exercised
with great energy and open-handedness in building it up again. A
festival was held there in October 1870, when five bells from the
foundry of Grassmayr of Wilten were set up to command the echoes of the
neighbourhood; great pains are now being taken to make the building
fireproof.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Close opposite Viecht lies Schwatz;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3129src" href="#xd21e3129" name="xd21e3129src">12</a> a number of
straggling houses, called &lsquo;die lange Gasse,&rsquo; on the Viecht
side belong to it also; between them there is a bridge, which we will
not cross now, but continue a little further along the left bank; this,
though less rich in smiling pastures than the right, has many points of
interest. The next village to Viecht is Vomp, situated at the entrance
of the Vomperthal, the sternest and most barren in scenery or
settlements of any valley of Tirol, and characterized by a hardy
pedestrian as &lsquo;frightfully solitary, and difficult of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>access: even the boldest J&auml;gers,&rsquo; he
adds, &lsquo;seldom pursue their game into it.&rsquo; The village
church of Vomp once possessed a priceless work of Albert <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e3134" title="Source: Durer">D&uuml;rer</span>, an
&lsquo;<i>Ancona</i>,&rsquo; showing forth in its various compartments
the history of the Passion; but it was destroyed in 1809, when the
French, under Deroi, set fire to the church in revenge for the havoc
the Tirolean sharp-shooters had committed among their ranks. Joseph
Arnold (in 1814) did his best to repair the loss, by painting another
altar-piece, in which we see a less painful than the usual treatment of
the martyrdom of St. Sebastian: the artist has chosen the moment at
which the young warrior is being bound to the tree where he is to
suffer so bravely. Above the village stands the once splendid castle of
Sigmundslust, one of the hunting-seats of Sigismund the Monied
(<i lang="de">der M&uuml;nzreiche</i>),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3144src" href="#xd21e3144" name="xd21e3144src">13</a> now the
villa of a private family of Innsbruck, Riccabona by name. Vomp is also
the birth-place of Joseph Hell, the wood-carver.</p>
<p>Crossing the Vomperbach, and the fertile plain it waters, you reach
Terfens, which earned some renown <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147"
href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>in the wars of &lsquo;the
year nine.&rsquo; Outside the village is a little pilgrimage chapel,
called Maria-Larch, honoured in memory of a mysterious image of the
blessed Virgin, found under a larch fir on the spot, similar to the
legend of that at Waldrast.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3154src" href=
"#xd21e3154" name="xd21e3154src">14</a></p>
<p>Passing the ruin of Volandseck, the still inhabited castle of
Thierberg (the third of the name we have passed since we entered Tirol)
and the village of S. Michael, you come to S. Martin, the parish church
of which owes its endowment to a hermit of modern times. There was in
the village a convent, deserted, because partly destroyed by fire. In
1638, George Thaler, of <span class="corr" id="xd21e3162" title=
"Source: Kitzbuhel">Kitzb&uuml;hel</span>, a man of some means and
position, came to live here a life of sanctity: he devoted six hours
a-day to prayer, six to sleep, and the rest to manual labour. He
maintained a chaplain, and an old servant who waited on him for fifty
years. At his death, he left all he possessed to supply the spiritual
needs of the hamlet. After leaving S. Martin&rsquo;s, the scenery grows
more pleasing: you enter the Gnadenwald, so called, because its first
inhabitants were servants of the earlier princes of Tirol, who
pensioned them off with holdings of the surrounding territory. It
occupies the lowland bordering the river, which here widens a little,
and affords in its recesses a number of the most romantic strolls.
Embowered on its border, near the river, stands the village of
Baumkirchen, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148"
name="pb148">148</a>]</span>its outlying offshoot of Fritzens now
surpassing it in importance, as it has been chosen for the
railway-station. The advance of the iron road has not stamped out the
native love for putting prominently forward the external symbols of
religion. I one day saw a countryman alight here from the railway, who
had been but to Innsbruck to purchase a large and handsome metal cross,
to be set up in some prominent point of the village and it was
considered a sufficiently important occasion for several neighbours to
go out to meet him on his return with it. Again, on the newer houses,
probably called into existence by the increased traffic, the old custom
of adorning the exterior with frescoes of sacred subjects is well kept
up. This is indeed the case on many other parts of the line; but at
Fritzens, I was particularly struck with one of unusual merit, both in
its execution and its adaptation to the domestic scene it was to
sanctify. I would call the attention of any traveller, who has time to
stop at Fritzens to see it: the treatment suggests that I should give
it the title of &lsquo;the Holy Family <i>at home</i>,&rsquo; so
completely has the artist realized the lowly life of the earthly
parents of the Saviour, and may it not be a comfort to the peasant
artizan to see before his eyes the very picture of his daily toil
sanctified in its exercise by the hands of Him he so specially
reveres?</p>
<p>An analogous incident, which I observed on another occasion, comes
back to my memory: it happened, I think, one day at Jenbach. The train
stopped to set down a Sister of Charity, who had come to nurse some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>sick person in the village. The
ticket-collector, who was also pointsman, was so much occupied with his
deferential bowing to her as he took her ticket, that he had to rush to
his points &lsquo;like mad,&rsquo; or his reverent feelings might have
had serious consequences for the train! So religious indeed is your
whole <i>entourage</i> while in Tirol, that I have remarked when
travelling through just this part in the winter season, that the very
masses of frozen water, arrested by the frost as they rush down the
railway cuttings and embankments, assumed in the half-light such forms
as Dor&eacute; might give to prostrate spectres doing penance. The
foot-path on to Hall leads through a continuance of the same
diversified and well-wooded scenery we have been traversing hitherto;
but if time presses, it is well to take the railway for this stage, and
make Hall or Innsbruck a starting-point for visiting the intervening
places.</p>
<p>Hall is the busiest and most business-like place we have come to
yet, and the first whose smoky atmosphere reminds us of home. There is
not much to choose between its two inns the &lsquo;Schwarzer
B&auml;r&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Schwarzer Adler.&rsquo; The industry and
the smoke of Hall arises from the salt-works, from which Weber also
derives its name (from <span class="trans" title="halos"><span class=
"Greek" lang="el">&#7937;&lambda;&#8057;&sigmaf;</span></span>, salt;
though <i>why</i> it should have been derived from the Greek he does
not explain). The first effect which strikes you on arriving, after the
smokiness, is the sky-line of its bizarrely-picturesque steeples, among
the most bizarre of which is the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150"
href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span><i lang=
"de">M&uuml;nzthurm</i> (the mint-tower), first raised to turn into
money the over-flowing silver stores of Sigismund <i>the Monied</i>;
and last used to coin the <i lang="de">Sandwirthszw&auml;nziger</i>,
the pieces of honest old Hofer&rsquo;s brief but triumphant
dictatorship. The town has in course of time suffered severely from
various calamities: fire, war, pestilence, inundation, and, on one
occasion, in 1670, even from earthquake; the church tower was so
severely shaken, that the watchman on its parapet was thrown to the
ground; the people fled from their houses into the fields, where the
Jesuit fathers stood addressing them, in preparation for their last
end, which seemed imminent. Loss of life was, however, small;
nevertheless, the Offices of the Church were for a long time held in
the open air. Notwithstanding all these reverses, the trade in salt,
and the advantageous municipal rights granted them in earlier times,
have always enabled the people to recover and maintain their
prosperity. In the various wars, they have borne their part with signal
honour. One of their greatest feats, perhaps, occurred on May 29, 1809.
Speckbacher had led his men to a gallant attack on the Bavarians at
Volders, blowing up the bridge behind him, and then marched to the
relief of Hall; the Bavarians were in possession of the town and
bridge, and as they had several pieces of artillery, it was not easy
for the patriots to carry it; nevertheless, as their ammunition was
failing, and Speckbacher having refused to agree to a truce, because he
saw the advantage accruing to him through this deficiency, they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>destroyed the Hall bridge, as they thought, and
retreated homewards under cover of the night. Speckbacher discovered
their flight early in the morning, and lost no time in addressing his
men on the importance of at once taking possession of their native
town: the men were as usual at one with him, and not one shrank from
the perilous enterprise of regaining the left bank by such means as the
tottering remains of the bridge afforded!</p>
<p>Joseph Speckbacher, who shares with Andreas Hofer the glories of
&lsquo;the year nine,&rsquo; was a native of Rinn, a village on the
opposite bank; but he is honoured with a grave in the Pfarrkirche, at
Hall, bearing the following inscription, with the date of his death,
1820:</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Im Kampfe wild, doch menschlich;</p>
<p class="line">In Frieden still und den Gesetzen treu;</p>
<p class="line">War er als Krieger, Unterthan und Mensch,</p>
<p class="line">Der Ehre wie der Liebe werth.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3215src" href="#xd21e3215" name="xd21e3215src">15</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Another object of interest, in the same churchyard, is
a wooden crucifix, carved by Joseph Stocker in 1691; as well as the
monuments of the Fiegers, and other high families of the middle ages.
In the church itself is a &lsquo;Salvator Mundi&rsquo; of Albert
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3220" title=
"Source: Durer">D&uuml;rer</span>, on panel; the altarpiece of the high
altar is by Erasmus Quillinus, a pupil of Rubens. One of the chapels,
the Waldaufische Kapelle, was built in 1493&ndash;5, by one Florian von
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>Waldauf, to whom an eventful history attaches.
He was a peasant boy, whom his father&rsquo;s severity drove away from
home: for a long time he maintained himself by tending herds; after
that he went for a soldier in the Imperial army, where his talents
brought him under the special notice of the Emperor Frederick, and his
son <span class="corr" id="xd21e3225" title=
"Source: Mazimilian">Maximilian</span> I., who took him into their
councils and companionship. Maximilian made him knight of Waldenstein,
and gifted him with lands and revenues. His love of adventure took him
into many countries. On one journey, being in a storm at sea, the
memory of his early wilfulness overcame him, and he vowed that if he
came safe to land, he would build a chapel in his Tirolean home. He
subsequently fixed on the Pfarrkirche of Hall, as that in which to
fulfil his vow, being the parish church of the castle of Rettenberg
which Maximilian had bestowed on him, and enriched it with a wondrous
store of relics, which he had collected in his journeyings. Above
40,000 pilgrims flocked from every part of Tirol, to assist at the
consecration; and a goodly sight it must have been, when singing and
bearing the relics aloft, they streamed down the mountain side and
across the river, the last of the procession not having yet left the
gates of Castle Rettenberg, while the foremost had already reached the
chapel.</p>
<p>There are other churches in Hall; where that of S. Saviour now
stands was once a group of crazy cottages; but one day, in the year
1406, in one of them a poor man lay dying, and the priest bore him the
holy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>Viaticum, which knows no distinction between the
palace and the hovel: the furniture was as rickety as the tenements
themselves; the only table, on which the priest had deposited the
sacred vessels, propped against the wall for support, gave way by some
accident, and the <i lang="it">Santissimo</i> was thrown upon the
floor. Johann von Kripp, a wealthy burgher, hearing of what had
befallen, bought the cottages, and in reparation for the desecration,
built a church on the spot, with the dedication, <i lang="de">zum
Erl&ouml;ser</i>.</p>
<p>The town is well provided with educational and charitable
institutions; the latter comprising a mad-house worth seeing, under
Professor Kaplan, and a deaf and dumb school. The Franciscan monastery
is, I think, the only unsuppressed religious house. In the <i lang=
"de">Rathhaus</i> is preserved a quaint old picture, representing the
Emperor Sigismund, in hunting costume, coming to ask the assistance of
the men of Hall against a conspiracy he had discovered in Innsbruck,
assistance which loyal Hall was not slow to supply. Its situation made
it a place of some importance to the defences of the country; and the
regulations for calling the inhabitants under arms were very complete,
so that this service was promptly rendered.</p>
<p>An amusing story is told in evidence of the ready gallantry of the
men of Hall. There was a time when Hall was at feud with the
neighbouring village of Taur: the watchman, stationed on the tower by
night-time, rang the alarm, and announced that the enemy was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>advancing with lanterns in their hands; at the
call to arms, every man jumped from his bed, and seized his weapon,
eager to display his prowess against the foe. Prudent
<i>Salzmair</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3249src" href="#xd21e3249"
name="xd21e3249src">16</a> Zott, anxious to spare the shedding of
neighbours&rsquo; blood, hastily donned a shirt of mail over his more
penetrable night-gear, and proposed to ride out alone with a flag of
truce, to know what meant the unseasonable attack. The warlike burghers
with difficulty yielded to his representations, and not having the
consolations of the fragrant weed wherewith to wile away their time,
set to sharpening their swords and axes, and outvieing each other with
many a fierce boast during his absence.</p>
<p>Meantime, <i>Salzmair</i> Zott proceeded on his way without meeting
the ghost of a foe, or one ray from their lanterns, till he came to
Taur itself, where everything lay buried in peaceful silence. Only as
he came back he discovered what had given rise to the alarm: it was
midsummer-tide, and a swarm of <i>little worms of St. John</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3259src" href="#xd21e3259" name=
"xd21e3259src">17</a> was soaring and fluttering over the fields like a
troop provided with lanterns. So with a hearty laugh he despatched the
townsmen, ready for the fight, back to their beds. And even now this
humorous imitation of the <i lang="de">Bauernkrieg</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3266src" href="#xd21e3266" name=
"xd21e3266src">18</a> is a by-word for Quixotic enterprises.</p>
<p>Of all the numerous excursions round Hall, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>strangest and most interesting is that to
Salzberg, the source of the salt, the <span class="corr" id="xd21e3273"
title="Source: crystalizing">crystallizing</span> of which and
despatching it all over Tirol, to Engadein and to Austria, forms the
staple industry of Hall. It is a journey of about three hours, though
not much over eight miles, but rugged and steep, and in some parts
rather frightful, particularly in the returning descent, for the
Salzberg lies 6,300 feet above the sea: but there is a road for an
<i lang="de">einspanner</i> all the way; entrance is readily obtained,
and the gratuities for guide, lighting up, and boat over the
subterranean salt lake, exceedingly moderate. There are records extant
which shew that there were salt-works in operation in the neighbourhood
of Hall early in the eighth century, but these would appear to have
been fed by a salt spring which flowed at the foot of the mountain. In
the year 1275, however, Niklas von Rohrbach, who seems to be always
styled <i lang="de">der fromme Ritter</i> (the pious knight),
frequently when on his hunting expeditions in the Hallthal, observed
how the cattle and wild game loved to lick certain cliffs of the
valley; this led him to test the flavour, and finding it rich in salt,
he followed up the track till he came to the Salzberg itself, where he
prudently conjectured there was an endless supply to be
obtained.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3282src" href="#xd21e3282" name=
"xd21e3282src">19</a> Ever since this time the salt has been worked
pretty much in the same way, namely, by hewing, later by blasting, vast
chambers in the rock, which are then filled with water and closed up:
at the end of some ten or twelve <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156"
href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>months, when the water is
supposed to be thoroughly impregnated, it is run off through a series
of conduits to Hall, where it is evaporated, a hundred pounds of brine
yielding about a third the weight of salt. A considerable number of
these chambers, an acre or two in extent, have been excavated in the
course of time, and you are told that it would take more than a week to
walk through all the passages connecting them. &lsquo;Cars filled with
rubbish pass you as you thread them,&rsquo; says an observant writer,
&lsquo;with frightful rapidity; you step aside into a niche, and the
young miners seated in the front look like gnomes directing infernal
chariots. The crystallizations in some of these chambers lighted up by
the torches of a party of visitors have a magical effect, and recall
the gilded fret-work of some Moorish palaces. There is a tradition that
Hofer and Speckbacher, who never, before their illustrious campaigns,
had wandered so far as these few miles from their respective homes,
took advantage of the lull succeeding their first triumph at Berg Isel,
to come over and visit the strange labyrinths of the Salzberg. It is
hardly possible to exaggerate the effect which such a scene might
produce on minds so imaginative, and at the same time so
unsophisticated. It is not difficult to believe that they regarded such
a journey like a visit to the abode of the departed great, or that in
presence of the oppressive grandeurs of nature they should have matured
their spirit for the defence of their country which was to confound the
strategy of practised generals. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157"
href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>Returning through the dark forests of pine and the steep cliffs of
the Hallthal, otherwise called the Salzthal, you are arrested by the
hamlet of Absam, which in your hurry to push forward you overlooked in
the morning. Before reaching it you observe to the east, on an eminence
rising out of the plain, Schloss Melans, now serving as a villa to a
family of Innsbruck. The peasants have a curious story to account for
the rudely sculptured dragons which adorn some of the eave-boards of
their houses, though no singular mode of ornamentation, and by others
accounted for differently.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3291src" href=
"#xd21e3291" name="xd21e3291src">20</a> They say that in olden time
there was a wonderful old hen which laid her first egg when seven years
old, and when the egg was hatched a dragon crept out of it,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3303src" href="#xd21e3303" name=
"xd21e3303src">21</a> which made itself a home in the neighbouring
moor, and the people in memory of the prodigy carved its likeness on
their houses.</p>
<p>In Absam itself once lived a noble family of the name of Spaur,
which had a toad for a bearing on their shield, accounted for in the
following way:&mdash;&lsquo;A certain Count Spaur had committed a crime
by which he had incurred the penalty of death; his kinsmen having put
every means in motion to get the sentence remitted, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>his
pardon was at last accorded them on the condition that he should ride
to Babylon the Accursed, and bring home with him a monstrous toad which
infested the tower. So the knight rode forth to Babylon the Accursed,
and when he drew near the tower the monstrous toad came out and seized
the bridle of the knight&rsquo;s horse; the knight, nothing daunted at
the horrid apparition, lifted his good sword and hewed the monster to
the ground, bringing the corpse back with him as a trophy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What audacious tales! Could anyone out of a dream put such ideas
together? No writer of fiction, none but one who believed them possible
of accomplishment! &lsquo;Who can tell what gives to these simple old
stories their irresistible witchery?&rsquo; says Max M&uuml;ller.
&lsquo;There is no plot to excite our curiosity, no gorgeous
description to dazzle our eyes, no anatomy of human passion to rivet
our attention. They are short and quaint, full of downright absurdities
and sorry jokes. We know from the beginning how they will end. And yet
we sit and read and almost cry, and we certainly chuckle, and are very
sorry when</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Snip, snip, snout,</p>
<p class="line">This tale&rsquo;s told out.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Do they remind us of a distant home&mdash;of a happy
childhood? Do they recall fantastic dreams long vanished from our
horizon, hopes that have set never to rise again?... Nor is it
dreamland altogether. There is a kind of <i>real</i> life in these
tales&mdash;life such as a child believes in&mdash;a life where good is
always rewarded; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159"
name="pb159">159</a>]</span>wrong always punished; where everyone, not
excepting the devil, gets his due; where all is possible that we truly
want, and nothing seems so wonderful that it might not happen
to-morrow. We may smile at those dreams of inexhaustible possibility,
but in one sense the child&rsquo;s world is a real world
too.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>A singular event, or curious popular fancy, obtained for Absam the
honour of becoming a place of pilgrimage at the end of the last
century. It was on January 17, 1797; a peasant&rsquo;s daughter was
looking idly out of window along the way her father would come home
from the field; suddenly, in the firelight playing on one of the panes,
she discerned a well-defined image of the Blessed Virgin, &lsquo;as
plain as ever she had seen a painting.&rsquo; Of course the neighbours
flocked in to see the sight, and from them the news of the wonderful
image spread through all the country round; at last it made so much
noise, that the Dean of Innsbruck resolved to investigate the matter. A
commission was appointed for this object, among their number being two
professors of chemistry, and the painter, Joseph Sch&ouml;pf. Their
verdict was that the image had originally been painted on the glass;
that the colours, faded by time, had been restored to the extent then
apparent by the action of the particular atmosphere to which they had
been exposed. The people could not appreciate their arguments, nor
realize that any natural means could have produced so extraordinary a
result. For them, it was a miraculous <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>image still, and
accordingly they put their faith in it as such; nor was their faith
without its fruit. It was a season of terrible trouble, a pestilence
was raging both among men and beasts; General Joubert had penetrated as
far into the interior as Sterzing; everyone felt the impotence of
&lsquo;the arm of flesh&rsquo; in presence of such dire calamities. The
image on the peasant&rsquo;s humble window-pane seemed to have come as
a token of heavenly favour; nothing would satisfy them but that it
should be placed on one of the altars of the church, and the
&lsquo;<i lang="de">Gnadenmutter<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3342src"
href="#xd21e3342" name="xd21e3342src">22</a> von Absam</i>&rsquo; drew
all the fearful and sorrowing to put their trust in Heaven alone.
Suddenly after this the enemy withdrew his troops, the pestilence
ceased its havoc, and more firmly than ever the villagers believed in
the supernatural nature of the image on the window-pane.</p>
<p>Absam has another claim to eminence in its famous violin-maker,
Jacob Stainer, born in 1649. He learnt his art in Venice and Cremona,
and carried it to such perfection, that his instruments fetched as high
prices as those made in Cremona itself. Archduke Ferdinand Karl,
<i lang="de">Landesf&uuml;rst</i> of Tirol, attached him to his court.
Stainer was so particular about the wood he used, that he always went
over to the Gletscher forest clearings to select it, being guided in
the choice by the sound it returned when he struck it with a hammer.
Towards the end of his life the excitement of the love of his calling
overpowered his strength of mind, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>the treatment of
insanity not being then brought to perfection at Absam, one has yet to
go through the melancholy exhibition of the stout oaken bench to which
he had to be strapped or chained when violent.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3353src" href="#xd21e3353" name="xd21e3353src">23</a></p>
<p>Mils affords the object of another pleasant excursion from Hall,
reached through the North, or so called Mils, gate, in an easy
half-hour; around it are the old castles of Gr&uuml;negg and
Schneeburg, the former a hunting-seat of Ferdinand II., now in ruins;
the latter well-preserved by the present noble family of the name.
Those who have a mind to enjoy a longer walk, may hence also find a way
into the peaceful shady haunts of the Gnadenwald. Some two hundred
years ago there lived about half way between Hall and Mils a
bell-founder, who enjoyed the reputation of being a very worthy upright
man, as well as one given to unfeigned hospitality; so that not only
the weather-bound traveller, but every wayfarer who loved an
hour&rsquo;s pleasant chat, knocked, as he passed by, at the door of
the <i lang="de">Glockenhof</i>. Among all the visitors who thus sat at
his board, none were so jovial as a party of wild fellows, whose
business he was never well able to make out. They always brought their
own meat and drink with them, and it was always of the best; and money
seemed to them a matter of no account, so abundant was it. At last he
ventured one day to inquire whence they acquired their seemingly
boundless <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>wealth. &lsquo;Nothing easier, and you may be as
rich as we, if you will!&rsquo; was the answer; and then they detailed
their exploits, which proved them knights of the road. Opportunity
makes the thief. The proverb was realized to the letter; the <i lang=
"de">Glockengiesser</i> had been honest hitherto, because he had never
been tempted before; now the glittering prize was exposed to him, he
knew not how to resist. His character for hospitality made the <i lang=
"de">Glockenhof</i> serve as a very trap. The facility increased his
greed, and his cellars were filled with spoil and with the skeletons of
the spoiled. Travellers thus disappeared so frequently that
consternation was raised again and again, but who could ever suspect
the worthy hearty <i lang="de">Glockengiesser</i>! Though the new trade
throve so well, there was one quality necessary to its success in which
the <i lang="de">Glockengiesser</i> was wanting, and that was caution.
Just as if there had been nothing to hide, he let a party of
sewing-women come one day from the village to set his household goods
in order; and when they retired to rest at night, one of them, who
could not sleep in a strange house, heard the master and his gang
counting their money in the cellar. Astonished, she crept nearer, and
over-heard their talk. &lsquo;We should not have killed that
fellow,&rsquo; said one; &lsquo;he wasn&rsquo;t worth powder and
shot.&rsquo; &lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo; replied another, &lsquo;you
can&rsquo;t expect to have good luck out of <i>every</i> murder. Why,
how often a cattle-dealer kills a beast and doesn&rsquo;t turn a penny
out of it.&rsquo; The seamstress did not want to hear any more;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>she laid her charge at the town-hall of Hall
next morning; the officers of justice arrested the bell-founder and his
associates, and ample proofs of their guilt were found on the premises.
Sentenced to death, in the solitude of his cell, he yielded to the full
force of the reproaches of his conscience; he made no defence, but
hailed his execution as a satisfaction of which his penitent soul
acknowledged the justice. However, he craved two favours before his
end; the one, to be allowed to go home and found a bell for the
<i lang="de">lieb&rsquo; Frau Kirche</i> in Mils; the second, that this
bell might be sounded for the first time at his execution, which by
local custom must be on a Friday evening at nine
o&rsquo;clock.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3387src" href="#xd21e3387"
name="xd21e3387src">24</a> Both requests were granted, and his bell
continued to serve the church of Mils till the fire of August 1791.</p>
<p>Another walk from Hall is the Loreto-Kirche, intended as an exact
copy of &lsquo;the Holy House,&rsquo; by Archduke Ferdinand and his
wife, the pious Anna Katharina of Gonzaga, who endowed it with a
foundation for perpetual Masses for the repose of the souls of the
reigning House of Austria; it was at one time a much visited
pilgrimage, so that though it had three chaplains attached to it, monks
from Hall had often to be sent for to supplement their ministrations.
Ferdinand and Anna often made the pilgrimage on foot from Innsbruck,
saying the &lsquo;stations&rsquo; as they went, at certain little
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>chapels which marked them by the way, and of
which remains are still standing. It would be an interesting spot to
trace out: I regret that we neglected to do so, and I do not know
whether it is now well kept up.</p>
<p>Starting again by the North gate of Hall, and taking the way which
runs in the opposite direction from that leading to Mils, you come,
after half an hour&rsquo;s walk through the pleasant meadows, to
Heiligen Kreuz; its name was originally Gumpass, but it had its present
name from the circumstance of a cross having been carried down stream
by the Inn, and recovered from its waters by some peasants from this
place, by whom it was set up here. So great is the popular veneration
for any even apparent act of homage of Nature to &lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s
God,&rsquo; that great crowds congregated to see the cross which had
been brought to them by the river; and it was found necessary in the
seventeenth century to erect the spot into a distinct parish. Heiligen
Kreuz is much resorted to for its sulphur baths, also by people from
Hall as a pleasing change from their smoky town, on holidays.</p>
<p>Striking out towards the mountains, another half-hour brings you to
Taur, a charming little village, standing in the shelter of the
Taureralpe. Almost close above it is the Th&uuml;rl, a peak covered to
a considerable height with rich pasture; at its summit, a height of
6,546 ft., is a wooden pyramid recording that it was climbed by the
Emperor Francis I., and called the <span class="corr" id="xd21e3401"
title="Source: Kaisersa&uuml;le">Kaisers&auml;ule</span>. There are
many legends of S. Romedius <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href=
"#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>connected with Taur, one of which
is worth citing, in illustration of the confidence of the age which
conceived or adapted it, in the efficacy of faith and obedience. S.
Romedius was a rich Bavarian, who in the fourth century owned
considerable property in the Innthal, including Taur. On his return
from a pilgrimage to Rome, he put himself at the disposal of S.
Vigilius, the apostle of South Tirol, who despatched him to the
conversion of the Nonsthal, where he lived and died in the odour of
sanctity. He was not unmindful of his own Taur, but frequently visited
it to pour out his spiritual benedictions. He was once there on such a
visit, when he received a call from S. Vigilius. Regardless of his age
and infirmities, he immediately prepared for the journey over the
mountains to Trent. His nag, old and worn out like his master, he had
left to graze on the pastures at the foot of the Taureralpe, so he
called his disciple David, and bid him bring him in and saddle him.
Great was the consternation of the disciple on making the discovery
that the horse had been devoured by a bear. Saddened and cast down, he
came to his master with the news. Nothing daunted, S. Romedius bid him
go back and saddle the bear in its stead. The neophyte durst not
gainsay his master, but went out trusting in his word; the bear meekly
submitted to the bidding of the holy man, who bestrode him, and rode on
this singular mount into Trent. It is only a fitting sequel that the
legend adds, that at his approach all the bells of Trent rang
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>out a gladsome peal of welcome, without being
moved by human hands.</p>
<p>The lords of Taur gave the name to the place by setting up their
castle on the ruins of an old Roman tower (<i>turris</i>; <span lang=
"de">altromanisch</span>, <i>tour</i>). S. Romedius is not the only
hero from among them; the chronicles of their race are full of the most
romantic achievements; perhaps not the least of these was the
construction of the fortress, the rambling ruins of which still attest
its former greatness. Overhanging the bank of the Wildbach is the
chapel of S. Romedius, inhabited by a hermit as lately as the
seventeenth century, though the country-people are apt to confuse him
with S. Romedius himself!<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3419src" href=
"#xd21e3419" name="xd21e3419src">25</a> One dark night, as he was
watching in prayer, he heard the sound of tapping against his cell
window. Used to the exercise of hospitality, he immediately opened to
the presumed wayfarer: great was his astonishment to see standing
before him the spirit of the lately deceased parish priest, who had
been his very good friend. &lsquo;Have compassion on me, Frater
Joshue!&rsquo; he exclaimed; &lsquo;for when in the flesh I forgot to
say three Masses, for which the stipend had been duly provided and
received <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>by me, and now my penance is fearful;&rsquo; as
he spoke he laid his hand upon a wooden tile of the hermit&rsquo;s
lowly porch, who afterwards found that the impression of his burning
hand was branded into the wood. &lsquo;Now do you, my friend, say these
Masses in my stead; pray and fast for me, and help me through this
dreadful pain.&rsquo; The hermit promised all he wished, and kept his
promise; and when a year and a day had passed, the spirit tapped again
at the window, and told him he had gained his release. The tile, with
the brand-mark on it, may be seen hanging in the chapel, with an
inscription under it attesting the above facts, and bearing date 7th
February, 1660.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3425src" href="#xd21e3425"
name="xd21e3425src">26</a></p>
<p>At a very short distance further is another interesting little
village, Rum by name. It is situated close under the mountains, the
soil of which is very friable. A terrible landslip occurred in 1770;
the noise was heard as far as Innsbruck, where it was attributed to an
earthquake. Whole fields were covered with the <i lang=
"fr">d&eacute;bris</i>, some of which were said to be carried to a
distance of a mile and a half; the village just escaped destruction,
only an outlying smithy, which was buried, showed how near the danger
had come. If time presses, this excursion may be combined with the
last, and the Loreto-Kirche taken on the way back to Hall. <span class=

have quite the Etruscan idea of providing against after-death needs
with appliances connected with the mortal state. Dennis (<i>Cities and
Cemeteries of Etruria</i>, vol. i. p. 34) mentions more material traces
of Etruscan beliefs at Matrei, on the north side of the Brenner.
Somewhat further south more important remains still have of late years
been unearthed, as we shall have occasion to note by-and-by.</p>
<p class="footnote">The story in the text, in its depiction of
self-devotion, has much analogy with a Chinese legend told to me by Dr.
Samuel Birch, of the British Museum, concerning a man who sacrifices
his own life in order to put himself on fighting terms with a cruel
spirit which torments that of his dead companion. In its details it is
like the story I have pointed out in <i>Folklore of Rome</i> (the
&lsquo;Tale of the Pilgrim Husband,&rsquo; pp. 361&ndash;3 and xvii),
as the most devious from Christian teaching of any of the legends I
have met with in Rome; and it is particularly noteworthy in connexion
with Mr. Isaac Taylor&rsquo;s summary of the Etruscan creed
(<i>Etruscan Researches</i>, p. 270). &lsquo;The Turanian creed was
Animistic. The gods needed no gifts, but the wants of the ancestral
spirits had to be supplied: the spirits of the departed were served in
the ghost-world by the spirits of the utensils and ornaments which they
had used in life.&rsquo;) And in effect we find in every collection of
the contents preserved at the opening of Etruscan tombs, not only gems
and jewellery and household utensils, but remains also of every kind of
food.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3016" href="#xd21e3016src" name="xd21e3016">6</a></span> There is
something like this in Dean Milman&rsquo;s <i>Annals of St.
Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral</i>:&mdash;&lsquo;&ldquo;Others,&rdquo; adds
Bishop Braybroke, &ldquo;by the instigation of the devil, do not
scruple to play at ball, and other unseemly games, within the church
(he is speaking of St. Paul&rsquo;s), breaking the costly painted
windows, to the amazement of the spectators.&rdquo;&rsquo; Speaking of
the post-Reformation period, the Dean adds: &lsquo;If, when the
cathedral was more or less occupied by sacred subjects, the invasion of
the sanctuary by worldly sinners resisted all attempts at suppression;
now, that the daily service had shrunk into mere forms of prayer, at
best into a mere &lsquo;Cathedral Service,&rsquo; ... it cannot be
wondered at that the reverence, which all the splendour of the old
ritual could not maintain, died away altogether as Puritanism rose in
the ascendant.&rsquo; Mr. Longman, however (<i>The Three
Cathedrals</i>, p. 54&ndash;6), quotes the very stringent regulations
which were issued for the repression of such practices: perhaps the
legend constructor would say, these afford the reason why, though St.
Paul&rsquo;s was profaned like the church of Achensee, it did not
&lsquo;likewise perish.&rsquo;</p>

follows that (when mountain scenery is not the special object with the

reign, 1440&ndash;90, it was that the silver-mines of Tirol were
discovered; and the abundant influx, to the extent of 500 cwt.
annually, of the precious metal into his treasury, led him to treat its
stores as exhaustless; though the richest monarch of his time, his easy
open-handed disposition continually led him into debt, and made his
subjects finally induce him in his old age to resign in favour of his
cousin, the Emperor Maximilian I. It is a token of the simplicity of
the times, that one of the gravest reproaches against him was that he
indulged in the luxury of <i>silk stockings</i>! He married Eleanor,

<p class="first">It is time now to return to speak of Schwatz, of which
we caught a glimpse across the river as we left Viecht;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3466src" href="#xd21e3466" name="xd21e3466src">1</a>
and it is one of the most interesting towns, and centres of excursions,
in Tirol. It was a morning of bright promise which first brought us
there by the early hour of 8.15. To achieve this we had had to rise
betimes; it was near the end of August, when the mid-day sun is
overpowering; yet the early mornings were very cool, and the brisk
breezes came charged with a memory of snow from the beautiful chains of
mountains whose base we were hugging. The railway station, as if it
dared not with its modern innovation invade the rural retreat of
primitive institutions, was at a considerable distance from the
village, and we had a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href=
"#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>walk of some fifteen or twenty
minutes before we came within reach of even a chance of breakfast.</p>
<p>My own strong desire to be brought quite within the influence of
Tirolean traditions perhaps deadened my sensations of hunger and
weariness, but it was not so with all of our party; and it was with
some dismay we began to apprehend that the research of the primitive is
not to be made without some serious sacrifice of &lsquo;<i lang="fr">le
comfortable</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Our walk across the fields at last brought us to the rapid smiling
river; and crowning the bridge, stood as usual S. John Nepomuk, his
patient martyr&rsquo;s face gazing on the effigy of the crucified
Saviour he is always portrayed as bearing so lovingly, seeming so
sweetly all-enduring, that no light feeling of discontent could pass
him unrestrained. Still the call for breakfast is an urgent one with
the early traveller, and there seemed small chance of appeasing it.
Near the station indeed had stood a deserted building, with the word
&lsquo;<i lang="de">Restauration</i>&rsquo; just traceable on its
mouldy walls, but we had felt no inclination to try our luck within
them; and though we had now reached the village, we seemed no nearer a
more appetising supply. No one had got out of the train besides
ourselves; not a soul appeared by the way. A large house stood
prominently on our right, which for a moment raised our hopes, but its
too close proximity to a little church forbad us to expect it to be a
hostelry, and a scout of our party brought the intelligence that it was
a hospital; another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170"
name="pb170">170</a>]</span>building further on, on the left, gave
promise again, because painted all over with frescoes, which might be
the mode in Schwatz of displaying a hotel-sign; but no, it proved to be
a forge, and like the lintels marked by Morgiana&rsquo;s chalk, all the
houses of Schwatz&mdash;as indeed most of the houses of
Tirol&mdash;were found to be covered with sacred frescoes. At last a
veritable inn appeared, and right glad we were to enter its lowly
portal and find rest, even though the air was scented by the mouldering
furniture and neighbouring cattle-shed; though the stiff upright
worm-eaten chairs made a discordant grating on the tiled floor, and a
mildewed canvas, intended to keep out flies, completed the gloom which
the smallness of the single window began.</p>
<p>A repeated knocking at last brought a buxom maid out of the
cow-shed, who seemed not a little amazed at our apparition. &lsquo;Had
she any coffee! coffee, at that time of day&mdash;<i>of course
not</i>!&rsquo; True, the unpunctuality of the train, the delivery of
superfluous luggage to the care of the station-master, and our
lingering by the way, had brought us to past nine
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;an unprecedented hour for breakfast in Schwatz.
&lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we be content with wine? in a couple of hours
meat would be ready, as the carters came in to dine then.&rsquo; Meat
and coffee at the same repast, and either at that hour, were ideas she
could not at first take in. Nevertheless, when we detailed our needs,
astonishment gave way to compassion, and she consented to drop her
incongruous propositions, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>and to make us happy in our own
way. Accordingly, she was soon busied in lighting a fire, running to
fetch coffee and rolls&mdash;though she did not, as happened to me in
Spain, ask us to advance the money for the commission&mdash;and very
soon appeared with a tray full of tumblers and queer old crockery. The
black beverage she at last provided consisted of a decoction of nothing
nearer coffee than roasted corn, figs,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3490src" href="#xd21e3490" name="xd21e3490src">2</a> or acorns;
and the rolls had the strangest resemblance to leather; but the milk
and eggs were fine samples of dairy produce, for which Schwatz is
famous, and these and the luscious fruit made up for the rest.</p>
<p>I remember that the poet-author of one of the most charming books of
travel, in one of the most charming countries of Europe,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3498src" href="#xd21e3498" name="xd21e3498src">3</a>
deprecates the habit travel-writers have of speaking too much about
their fare; and in one sense his remarks are very just. Where this is
done without purpose or art, it becomes a bore; but &lsquo;love itself
can&rsquo;t live on flowers;&rsquo; and as, however humiliating the
fact, it is decreed that the only absolutely necessary business of
man&rsquo;s life is the catering for his daily bread, it becomes
interesting to the observant to study the various means by which this
decree is complied with by different races, in different localities. It
is especially noteworthy that it is just in countries made supercilious
by their culture that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href=
"#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>these matters of a lower order
engross the most attention, and just those who consider themselves the
most civilized who are the most dependent on what have been termed mere
&lsquo;creature comforts.&rsquo; These poor country folks, whom the
educated traveller often passes by as unworthy of notice in their
benighted ignorance and superstition&mdash;while they would not forego
their salutation of the sacred symbol by the way-side, which marks
their intimate appreciation of truths of the highest order&mdash;put us
to shame, by their indifference to sublunary indulgences. We had come
to Tirol to study their ways, and I hope we took our lesson on this
occasion, well. We were not feasted with a sumptuous repast, such as
might be found in any of the monster hotels, now so contrived, that you
may pass through all the larger towns of Europe with such similarity to
home-life everywhere, that you might as well never have left your
fireside; but we were presented with an experience of the struggle with
want; of that hardy face-to-face meeting with the great original law of
labour, which our modern artificial life puts so completely out of
sight, that it grows to regard it as an antiquated fable, and which can
only be met amid such scenes.</p>
<p>The matutinal peasants were packing up their wares&mdash;which when
spread out had made a picturesque market of the main street&mdash;by
the time we again sallied forth, and we were nearly losing what is
always one of the prettiest sights in a foreign town. At the end rose
the parish church, with a stateliness for which the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>smallness of the village had not prepared us;
but Schwatz has a sad and eventful history to account for the
disparity.</p>
<p>Schwatz was once a flourishing Roman station, and even now remains
are dug out which attest its ancient prosperity; but it had fallen away
to the condition of a neglected <i lang="de"><span class="corr" id=
"xd21e3513" title="Source: Hausergruppe">H&auml;usergruppe</span></i>
by the fourteenth century, when suddenly came the discovery of silver
veins in the surrounding heights. A lively bull,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3516src" href="#xd21e3516" name="xd21e3516src">4</a> one day
tearing up the soil with his horns in a frolic, laid bare a shining
vein of ore. The name of Gertraud Kandlerin, the farm-servant who had
charge of the herd to which he belonged, and brought the joyful tidings
home to Schwatz, has been jealously preserved. From that moment Schwatz
grew in importance and prosperity; and at one time there was a
population of thirty thousand miners employed in the immediate
neighbourhood. The Fuggers and Hochstetters of Augsburg were induced to
come and employ their vast resources in working the riches of the
mountains; and native families of note, laying aside the pursuit of
arms, joined in the productive industry. Among these were the Fiegers,
one of whom was the counsellor and intimate friend of the Emperor
Maximilian, who followed his remains to their last resting-place, at
Schwatz, when he died in ripe old age, leaving fifty-seven children and
grandchildren, and money enough <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174"
href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>to enrich them all. His son
Hanns married a daughter of the Bavarian house of Pienzenau; and when
he brought her home, tradition says it was in a carriage drawn by
<i>four thousand</i> horses. Many names, famous in the subsequent
history of the country, such as the T&auml;nzls, J&ouml;chls,
Tannenbergs, and Sternbachs, were thus first raised to importance. This
outpouring of riches stimulated the people throughout the country to
search for mineral treasures, and everywhere the miners of Schwatz were
in request as the most expert, both at excavating and engineering. Nor
this only within the limits of Tirol; they had acquired such a
reputation by the middle of the sixteenth century, that many distant
undertakings were committed to them too. They were continually applied
to, to direct mining operations in the wars against the Turks in
Hungary. Their countermines performed an effective part in driving them
from before Vienna in 1529; and again, in 1739, they assisted in
destroying the fortifications of <span class="corr" id="xd21e3527"
title="Source: Belgrad">Belgrade</span>. Clement VII. called them to
search the mountains of the Papal State in 1542; and the Dukes of
Florence and Piedmont also had recourse to their assistance about the
same time. In the same way, many knotty disputes about mining rights
were sent from all parts to be decided by the experience of Schwatz;
and its abundance attracted to it every kind of merchandise, and every
new invention. One of the earliest printing-presses was in this way set
up here.</p>
<p>But a similarity of pursuit had established a community <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>of
interest between the miners of Schwatz and their brethren of Saxony;
and when the Reformation broke out, its doctrines spread by this means
among the miners of Schwatz, and led at one time to a complete
revolution among them. Twice they banded together, and marched to
attack the capital, with somewhat communistic demands. Ferdinand I.,
and Sebastian, Bishop of Brixen, went out to meet them on each occasion
at Hall, and on each occasion succeeded in allaying the strife by their
moderate discourse. Within the town of Schwatz, however, the innovators
carried matters with a high hand, and at one time obtained possession
of half the parish church, where they set up a Lutheran pulpit. Driven
out of this by the rest of the population, they met in a neighbouring
wood, where Joham Strauss and Christof S&ouml;ll, both unfrocked monks,
used to hold forth to them.</p>
<p>A Franciscan, Christof von M&uuml;nchen, now came to Schwatz, to
strengthen the faith of the Catholics, and the controversy waged high
between the partisans of both sides; so high, that one day two excited
disputants carried their quarrels so far before a crowd of admiring
supporters, that at last the Lutheran exclaimed, &lsquo;If Preacher
S&ouml;ll does not teach the true doctrine, may Satan take me up into
the Steinjoch at Stans!&rsquo; and as he spoke, so, says the story, it
befell: the astonished people saw him carried through the air and
disappear from sight! The credit of the Lutherans fell very sensibly on
the instant, and still more some days after, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>when
the adventurous victim came back lame and bruised, and himself but too
well convinced of his error.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the strife was not cured. Somewhat later, there was an
inroad of Anabaptists, under whose auspices another insurrection arose,
and for the time the flourishing mining works were brought to a
stand-still. At last the Government was obliged to interfere. The most
noisy and perverse were made to leave the country, and the Jesuits from
Hall were sent over to hold a mission, and rekindle the Catholic
teaching. Peace and order were restored: four thousand persons were
brought back to the frequentation of the sacraments; but the <i lang=
"de">Bergsegen</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3544src" href=
"#xd21e3544" name="xd21e3544src">5</a> add the traditions, which had
been the occasion of so much <span class="corr" id="xd21e3550" title=
"Source: dissunion">disunion</span>, was never recovered. From that
time forth the mining treasures of Schwatz began to fail; and after a
long and steadily continued diminution of produce, silver ceased
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3553" title=
"Source: altogother">altogether</span> to be found. Copper, and the
best iron of Tirol, are still got out, and their working constitutes
one of the chief industries of the place; the copper produced is
particularly fit for wire-drawing, for which there is an establishment
here. Another industry of Schwatz is a government cigar
manufactory,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3556src" href="#xd21e3556"
name="xd21e3556src">6</a> which employs between four and five hundred
hands, chiefly women and children, who get very poorly paid&mdash;ten
or twelve <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>francs a-week, working from five in the morning
till six in the evening, with two hours&rsquo; interval in the middle
of the day. There are pottery works, which also employ many hands; and
many of the women occupy themselves in knitting woollen clothing for
the miners. The pastures of the neighbourhood are likewise a source of
rich in-comings to the town; but with all these industries together,
Schwatz is far below the level of its early prosperity. Instead of its
former crowded buildings, it now consists almost entirely of one
street; and instead of being the cynosure of foreigners from all parts,
is so little visited, that the people came to the windows to look at
the unusual sight of a party of strangers as we passed by. In place of
its early printing-press, its literary requirements are supplied by one
little humble shop, where twine, toys, and traps, form the staple, and
stationery and a small number of books are sold over and above; and
where, because we spent a couple of francs, the master thereof seemed
to think he had driven for that one day a roaring trade.</p>
<p>Other misfortunes, besides the declension of its
&lsquo;Bergsegen,&rsquo; have broken over Schwatz. In 1611 it was
visited by the plague, in 1670 by an earthquake; but its worst disaster
was in the campaign of 1809, when the Bavarians, under the Duke of
Dantzic, and the French, under Deroi, determined to strike terror into
the hearts of the country-people by burning down the town. The most
incredible cruelties are reported to have been perpetrated on this
occasion, many being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178"
name="pb178">178</a>]</span>such as one cannot bear to repeat; so
determined was their fury, that when the still air refused to fan the
flames, they again and again set fire to the place at different points;
and the people were shot down when they attempted to put out the
conflagration. General Wiede was quartered in the palace of Count
Tannenberg, a blind old man, with four blind children; his misfortunes,
and the laws of hospitality, might have protected him at least from
participation in the general calamity; but no, not even the hall where
the hospitable board was spread in confidence for the unscrupulous
guest, was spared. Once and again, as the inimical hordes poured into,
or were driven out of, Tirol, Schwatz had to bear the brunt of their
devastations, so that there is little left to show what Schwatz was.
The stately parish church, however, suffered less than might have been
expected: in the height of the conflagration, when all was noise and
excitement, a young Bavarian officer, over whom sweet home lessons of
piety exercised a stronger charm than the wild instincts of the
military career which were effecting such havoc around, collected a
handful of trusty followers, and, unobserved by the general herd,
succeeded in rescuing it before great damage had been done.</p>
<p>The building was commenced about 1470,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3568src" href="#xd21e3568" name="xd21e3568src">7</a> and
consecrated in 1502. What remains of the original work is in the best
style of the period; the west front <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>is particularly
noteworthy. The plan of the building is very remarkable, consisting of
a double nave, each having its aisles, choir, and high-altar; this
peculiar construction originated in the importance of the <i lang=
"de">Knappen</i>, or miners, at the time it was designed, and their
contribution to the building fund entitling them to this distinct
division of the church between them and the towns-people; one of the
high-altars still goes by the name of the <i lang=
"de">Knappenhochaltar</i>. The roof, like those of most churches of
Tirol and Bavaria, is of copper, and is said to consist of fifteen
thousand tiles of that metal&mdash;an offering from the neighbouring
mines. The emblem of two crossed pick-axes frequently introduced,
further denotes the connexion of the mining trade with the building.
Whitewash and stucco have done a good deal to hide its original
beauties, but some fine monuments remain. One in brass, to Hanns
Dreyling the metal-founder, date 1578, near the side
(&lsquo;south&rsquo;) door, should not be overlooked: the design
embodies a Renaissance use of Ionic columns and entablature in
connexion with medi&aelig;val symbols. Below, are seen Hanns Dreyling
himself in the dress of his craft, his three wives, and his three sons
habited as knights (showing the rise of his fortunes), all under the
protection of S. John the Baptist. Above, is portrayed the vision of
the Apocalypse, God the Father seated on His Throne, surrounded by a
rainbow, with the Book of Seven Seals, and the Lamb; at His Feet the
four Evangelists; around, the four-and-twenty elders, with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>their harps, some wearing their crowns, and some
stretching them out as a humble offering before the Throne; in front
kneels the Apostolic Seer himself, gazing, and with his right hand
pointing, upwards, yet smiting his breast with the left hand, and
weeping that no one was found worthy to open the seals of the book.
Below the epitaph, the monument bears the following lines:</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Mir gab Alexander Colin den Possen</p>
<p class="line">Hanns L&ouml;ffler hat mich gegossen.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Alexander Colin, of Malines, and Hans L&ouml;ffler,
were, like Hans Dreyling, <i lang="de">Schmelzherrn</i> of eminence,
and connected with him by marriage, thus they naturally devoted their
best talent to honour their friend and master. We learnt to appreciate
it better when we came to see their works at Innsbruck. The nine
altar-pieces are mostly by Tirolean painters. The Assumption, on one
high-altar, is by Sch&ouml;pf; the Last Supper on the other&mdash;the
<i lang="de">Knappenhochaltar</i>&mdash;by Bauer of Augsburg.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;north&rsquo; side door opens on to a narrow strip of
grass, across which is a <i lang="de">Michaels-kapelle</i>, as the
chapel we so often find in German churchyards&mdash;and where the
people love to gather, and pray for their loved and lost&mdash;is here
called. It is a most beautiful little specimen of middle-pointed, with
high-pitched roof and traceried window. A picturesque stone-arched
covered exterior staircase, the banister cornice of which represents a
narrow water-trough, with efts chasing each other in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>and
out of it, leads to the upper chapel, which was in some little
confusion at the time of our visit, as it was under restoration; two or
three artists were in the lower chapel, painting the images of the
saints in the fresh colours the people love. After some searching, I
found out a figure of a dead Christ, which I was curious to see;
because, before coming to Schwatz, I had been told there was one which
had been dearly prized for centuries by the people; that once on a time
there had come night by night a large toad, and had stood before the
image, resting on its hinder feet, the two front ones joined as if in
token of prayer; and no one durst disturb it, because they said it must
be a suffering soul which they saw under its form. I spoke to one of
the artists about it, to see if this was the right image, and if the
legend was still acknowledged. He answered as one who had little
sympathy with the mysteries he was employed to delineate; he evidently
cared nothing for legends, though willing to paint them for money. It
was the first time I had met with this sort of spirit in the
neighbourhood, and was not surprised to learn he was not of Tirol, but
from Munich.</p>
<p>A door opposite the last named opens into the churchyard, filled
with the usual black and gold cast-iron crosses, and the usual
sprinkling of some of a brighter colour; each with its stoup of holy
water and <i lang="de">weihwedel</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3606src" href="#xd21e3606" name="xd21e3606src">8</a> and its
simple epitaph, &lsquo;<i lang="de">Hier ruhet in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span><span class="corr" id="xd21e3612" title=
"Source: Friede">Frieden</span></i>....&rsquo; Besides the large
crucifix, which always stands in the centre promising redemption to the
faithful departed, is a stout round pillar of large rough stones,
surmounted by a lantern cap with five sharp points, each face glazed,
and a lamp within before some relic, always kept alight, for the people
think<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3615src" href="#xd21e3615" name=
"xd21e3615src">9</a> that the holy souls come and anoint their burning
wounds with the oil which piously feeds a churchyard lamp. Twinkling
fitfully amid the evening shadows, over the graves, and over the human
skulls and bones, of which there happened fortuitously to be a heap
waiting re-sepulture after some late arrangement of the burying-ground,
it disposed one to listen to the strange tales which are told of it.
There was once a <i lang="de">Robler</i> of Schwatz, well-limbed,
deep-chested, full of confidence and energy, who had won the right to
wear the champion feather<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3622src" href=
"#xd21e3622" name="xd21e3622src">10</a> against the whole
neighbourhood. But not content to be the darling of his home, and the
pride of his valley, he must needs prove himself the best against all
comers. In fear of the shame of a reverse after all his boasts, he
resolved to ensure himself against one, by having recourse to an act,
originally designed probably as a test of possessing, but commonly
believed by the people to be a means of winning, invincible strength of
nerve, and which is described in the following narrative. Opportunity
was not lacking. Death is ever busy, and one day laid low an old
gossip, who was duly buried <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href=
"#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>with all honour by her children
and children&rsquo;s children to the third generation. Now was the time
for our brave <i lang="de">Robler</i>. That first night that she rested
in the &lsquo;field of peace,&rsquo; he rose in the dead of the
night&mdash;a dark starless night, just as it was when we stood
there&mdash;and the lamp of the shrine resting its calm pale rays upon
the graves. The great clock struck out twelve, with a rattling of its
cumbersome machinery, which sounded like skeletons walking by in
procession; our <i lang="de">Robler</i> quailed not, however, but
approached the new grave, scattered the earth from over it with his
spade, raised up the coffin, opened it, took out the corpse, dressed
himself in its shroud, and lifted the ghastly burden on to his strong
shoulders. Never had burden felt so heavy; it seemed to him as though
he bore the Freundsberg on his back; though sinking and quailing, he
bore it three times round the whole circuit of the enclosure, laid it
back in the coffin, and lowered the coffin into the grave; triumphantly
he showered the earth over it, and took quite a pleasure in shaping the
hillock smoothly and well. Then suddenly, to his horror, with a click
like the gripe of a skeleton, he heard the clapper of the old clock
raised to mark the completion of the hour within which his task, to be
effectual, must be accomplished. Meantime, it had come on to rain
violently, and the big drops pattered on the stones, like dead men
tramping all around him; it happened to fall heavily round us, and the
simile was so striking, I could not forbear a grim smile. It
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>seemed to him as if he never could dash through
their midst in time; still he made the attempt boldly, and actually
succeeded in swinging himself over the churchyard wall before the
hammer had fallen, and, what was most important, still bearing round
his shoulders the shroud of the dead. Nevertheless his heart was full
of anxiety with the thought that he had disturbed the peace of the
departed; it seemed to him as if the old gossip had run after him to
claim her own, and with her burning hand had seized the fluttering
garment, and torn a piece out of it, just as he cleared the wall. For
days after, the sexton saw the piece, torn and burnt, fluttering over
her grave, but never could make out how it got there. The <i lang=
"de">Robler</i>, however, was now proof against every attack; no one
could wear a feather in his presence, for he was sure to overcome him,
and make him renounce the prize. What did he gain, however, by his
uncannily-earned prowess? A little temporary renown and honour, and the
fear of his kind; but all through the rest of his life, at the <i lang=
"de">Wandlung</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3641src" href="#xd21e3641"
name="xd21e3641src">11</a> of the Holy Mass, the pure white wafer, as
the priest raised it aloft, seemed <i>black</i> to his eyes, and when
he came to die, there was no father-confessor near to whisper
absolution and peace.</p>
<p>A most singular legend, also attached to this spot, dates from the
time when the Jesuit Fathers held their missions after the expulsion of
the Lutherans. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>With the fervour of new conversion, the people
ascribed to their word the most wonderful powers; and their simple
unwavering faith seems to have been a loan of that which removes
mountains. Among those whom a spirit of penance moved to come and make
a general confession of their past lives was a lady no longer young, of
blameless character, but unmarried. The fathers, as I have already
implied, enjoyed the most unbounded confidence of the people; and the
most unusual penance was accepted in the simplest way. To this person
the penance enjoined was, that she should for three nights watch
through the hour of midnight in the church, and then come and give an
account of what she had seen. Being apparently a person of a strong
mind, she was satisfied with the assurance of the father that no harm
would happen to her, and she fulfilled her task bravely. &ldquo;When
she came to narrate what had passed, she said that each night the
church had been traversed by a countless train of men, women, and
children, of every age and degree, dressed in a manner unlike anything
she had seen or read of in the past; the features of all quite unknown
to her, and yet exhibiting a certain likeness, which might lead her to
believe they might be of her own family, and all wearing an expression
indescribably sad; she was all anxiety to know what she could do for
their relief, for she felt sure it was to move her to this that they
had been revealed to her. The father told her, however, this was not at
all the object of the vision: that the train of people she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>had
seen was an appearance of the generations of unborn souls, who might
have lived to the eternal honour and praise of God if she had not
preferred her ease and freedom and independence to the trammels of the
married state; &lsquo;for,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;your choice of
condition was based on this, not on the higher love of God, and the
desire of greater perfection. Now, therefore, reflect what profit your
past life has borne to the glory of God, and strive to make it glorify
Him in some way in the future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Franciscan church was built about the same time as the other,
and has some remains of the beautiful architecture of its date. Over
the credence table is a remarkable and very early painting on panel, of
the genealogy of our Lord. Within the precincts of the monastery are
some early frescoes, which I did not see; but they ought not to be
overlooked. One subject, said to be very boldly and strikingly handled,
is the commission to the Apostles to go out and preach the Gospel to
the nations.</p>
<p>The day was wearing on, and we had our night&rsquo;s lodging to
provide; the inn where we had breakfasted did not invite our
confidence, despite of the pretty Kranach&rsquo;s Madonna which smiled
over the parlour, and the good-natured maid who deemed it her business
to wait behind our chairs while we sipped our coffee; so we walked down
the long street, and tried our luck at one and another. There were
plenty of them: and they were easily recognized now we knew their
token, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>for each has a forbidden-fruit-tree painted on
the wall with some subject out of the New Testament surmounting it, to
show the triumph of the Gospel over the Fall; while the good gifts of
Providence, which mine host within is so ready to dispense, are
typified by festoons of grape-vines, surrounding the picture. Those
which let out horses have also a team cut out in a thin plate of
copper, and painted <i>proper</i>, as heralds say, fixed at right
angles to the doorpost. Nevertheless, the interiors were not inviting,
and at more than one the bedding was all on the roof, airing; and the
solitary maid, left in charge of the house while all the rest of the
household were in the fields harvesting, declared the impossibility of
getting so many beds as we wanted ready by the evening. Dinner at the
<i lang="de">Post</i> having somehow indisposed us for it, we at last
put up at the <i lang="de">Krone</i>, which was very much like a
counterpart of our first experience. Nothing could exceed the pleasant
willingness of the people of the house; but both their accommodation
and their cleanliness was limited; and besides a repulsive look, there
was an unaccountable odour, about the beds, which made sleeping in them
impossible. My astonishment may be imagined, when on proceeding to
examine whether there were any articles of bedding that would do to
roll oneself up in on the floor, I found that the smell proceeded from
layers of apples between the mattresses, which it seems to be the habit
thus to preserve for winter use!</p>
<p>The rooms were large and rambling, and filled with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>cumbersome furniture, some of which must, I
think, have been made before the great fire of 1809. As in all the
other houses, a guitar hung on the wall of the sitting-room; and after
many coy refusals, the daughter of the house consented to sing to it
one or two melodies very modestly and well.</p>
<p>You do not sleep very soundly on the floor, and by six next morning
the tingling of the Blessed Sacrament bell sufficed to rouse me in time
to see how the Schwatzers honour &lsquo;<i lang="de">das
hochw&uuml;rdigste Gut</i>,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3678src"
href="#xd21e3678" name="xd21e3678src">12</a> as it passed them on its
way to the sick. Two little boys in red cassocks went first, bearing
red banners and holy-water; two followed in red and yellow, bearing a
canopy over the priest, and four men carried lanterns on long poles.
The rain of the previous night had filled the road with puddles, but
along the whole way the peasants were on their knees. To all who are
afflicted with long illnesses, it is thus carried at least every
month.</p>
<p>The morning was bright and hot, but the ruined castle on the
neighbouring Freundsberg looked temptingly near; and we easily found a
rough but not difficult path, past a number of crazy cottages, the
inhabitants of which, however poor and hard worked, yet gave us the
cheerful Christian greeting, &lsquo;Gelobt sei Jesus Christus!&rsquo;
as we passed. Near the summit the cottages cease; and after a short
stretch in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>burning sun, you appreciate the shade afforded
by a tiny chapel, at the side of a crystal spring, welling up out of
the ground, its waters cleverly guided into a conduit, formed of a
hollowed tree, which supplies all the houses of the hill-side, and
perhaps accounts for their being so thickly clustered there. The last
wind of the ascent is the steepest and most slippery. The sun beat down
relentlessly, but seemed to give unfailing delight to myriads of
lizards, adders, and grasshoppers, who were darting and whirring over
the crumbling stones in the maddest way. Historians, poets, or
painters, have made some ruins so familiarly a part of the
world&rsquo;s life, and their grand memories of departed glories have
been so often recounted, that they seem stereotyped upon them. Time has
shattered and dismantled them, but has robbed them of nothing, for
their glories of all ages are concrete around them still. But poor
Freundsberg! who thinks of it? or of the thousand and one ruined
castles which mark the &lsquo;sky-line&rsquo; of Tirol with melancholy
beauty? Each has, however, had its throb of hope and daring, and its
day of triumph and mastery, often noble, sometimes&mdash;not so often
as elsewhere&mdash;base. Freundsberg is no exception. For two hundred
years before the Christian era it was a fortress, we know: for how long
before that we know not; and then again, we know little of what befell
it, till many hundred years after, in the twelfth, thirteenth, and
fourteenth centuries, its lords <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190"
href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>were known as mighty men of
war. It reached its highest glory under Captain Georg, son of Ulrich
and a Swabian heiress whose vast dowry tended to raise the lustre of
the house.</p>
<p>Georg von Freundsberg entered the career of arms in early youth, and
rose to be a general at an age when other men are making their <i lang=
"fr">premi&egrave;res armes</i>. At four-and-twenty he was reckoned by
Charles Quint his most efficient leader. Over the Swiss, over the
Venetians, wherever he led, he was victorious. The victory at Pavia was
in great measure due to his prowess. His personal strength is recorded
in fabulous terms; his foresight in providing for his men, and his art
of governing and attaching them, were so remarkable, that they called
him their father, and he could do with them whatever he would. They
recorded his deeds in the terms in which men speak of a hero: they said
that the strongest man might stand up against him with all his energy,
and yet with the little finger of his left hand he could throw him
down; that no matter at what fiery pace a horse might be running away,
if he but stretched his hand across the path he brought it to a stand;
that in all the Emperor&rsquo;s stores there was no field-piece so
heavy but he could move it with ease with one hand. They sang of
him:</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Georg von Freundsberg,</p>
<p class="line">von grosser Sterk,</p>
<p class="line">ein theurer Held;</p>
<p class="line">behielt das Feld <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191"
href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">in Streit und Krieg.</p>
<p class="line">den Feind niederslieg</p>
<p class="line">in aller Schlacht.</p>
<p class="line">er legt Got zu die Er und Macht.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3710src" href="#xd21e3710" name=
"xd21e3710src">13</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The last line would show that to a certain extent he
was not untrue to the traditions of his country; nevertheless, his
success in war, and his love for the Emperor, carried him so far away
from them, that when the siege of Rome was propounded, he not only
accepted a command in the attack on the &lsquo;Eternal City,&rsquo; but
raised twelve thousand men in his Swabian and Tirolean possessions to
support the charge. None who have pondered the havoc and the horrors of
that wanton and sacrilegious siege will care to extenuate the guilt of
any participator in it. It is the blot on Georg von Freundsberg&rsquo;s
character, and it was likewise his last feat. He died suddenly within
the twelvemonth, aged only fifty-two, leaving his affairs in
inextricable confusion, and his estate encumbered with debts incurred
in raising the troops who were to assist in the desolation of the
&lsquo;Holy City.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His brothers&mdash;Ulrich, Bishop of Trent, and Thomas, who like
himself followed the military calling&mdash;earned a certain share of
respect also; but no subsequent member of the family was distinguished,
and the race came to an end in 1580. The castle fell into ruin; and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>as if a curse rested on it, when it was used
again, it was to afford cover to the Bavarians in <i>firing upon the
people</i> in 1809! I do not know by what local tradition, but some
motive of affection still renders the chapel a place of pious resort;
and a copy of Kranach&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mari&auml;hilf&rsquo; adorns the
altar. The remaining tower affords a pleasing outline.</p>
<p>I returned to the chapel by the brook, and sat down to sketch it,
though rather too closely placed under it to view it properly; there is
always an indefinable satisfaction in making use of these places of
pious rest, which brotherly charity has provided for the unknown
wayfarer. When, after a time, I looked up from my paper, I saw sitting
outside in the sun a strange old woman, the stealthy approach of whose
shoeless feet I had not noticed. I advised her to come in and rest; and
then I asked her how she came to walk unshod over the stones of the
path, which were sharp and loose, as well as burning hot, while she
carried a pair of stout shoes in her hand. &lsquo;<i>That</i>
doesn&rsquo;t hurt,&rsquo; she replied indignantly; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
the shoes that hurt. When you put your foot down you know where you put
it, and you take hold of the ground; but when you have those things on,
you don&rsquo;t know where your foot goes, and down you go yourself.
That&rsquo;s what happened to me on this very path, and see what came
of it.&rsquo; And she bared her right arm, and showed that it had been
broken, and badly set, and now was withered and useless&mdash;she could
do no more work to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193"
name="pb193">193</a>]</span>support herself. I asked her how she lived,
and she did not like the question, for begging, it seems, is forbidden.
But I said it was a very hard law, and then she grew more confidential;
and after a little more talk, her wild weird style, and her strong
desire to tell my fortune, showed me she was one of those dangerous
devotees who may be considered the camp-followers of the Christian
army, whose chance of ingratiating themselves seems greatest where the
faith is brightest, and who there work all manner of mischief,
overlaying simple belief with pagan superstition; but at the same time,
such an one is generally a very mine for the comparative mythologist,
and in this individual instance not without some excuse in her
misfortunes. For, besides the unlucky disablement already named, she
had lost not only her house, home, and belongings, but all her
relations also, in a fire. It is not surprising if so much misery had
unhinged her mind. Her best means of occupation seemed to be, when good
people gave her alms, to go to a favourite shrine, and pray for them;
and I fully believe, from her manner, that she conscientiously
fulfilled such commissions, for I did not discover anything of the
hypocrite about her. Only once, when I had been explaining what a long
way I had come on purpose to see the shrines of her country, she amused
me by answering, in the most inflated style, that however far it might
be, it could not be so far as <i>she</i> had come&mdash;she came from
beyond mountains and seas, far, far, ever so far&mdash;till I looked at
her again, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>and wondered if she were a gipsy, and was
appropriating to her personal experience some of the traditional
wanderings of her race. Presently she acknowledged that her birth-place
was Seefeld, which I knew to be at no great distance from Innsbruck,
perhaps ten miles from where we stood. Yet this tone of exaggeration
may have arisen from an incapacity to take in the idea of a greater
distance than she knew of previously, rather than from any intention to
deceive; and her &lsquo;seas&rsquo; were of course lakes, which when
spoken of in the German plural have not even the gender to distinguish
them.</p>
<p>When she had once mentioned Seefeld, she grew quite excited, and
told me no place I had come from could boast of such a marvellous
favour as God had manifested to her Seefeld. I asked her to tell me
about it. &lsquo;What! don&rsquo;t you know about Oswald Milser?&rsquo;
and I saw my want of recognition consigned me to the regions of her
profoundest contempt. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know about Oswald Milser,
who by his pride quenched all the benefit of his piety and his
liberality to the Church? who, when he went to make his Easter
Communion one <i lang="de">gr&uuml;ne Donnerstag</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3739src" href="#xd21e3739" name="xd21e3739src">14</a> insisted
that it should be given him in one of the large Hosts, which the priest
uses, and so distinguish him from the people. And when the priest,
afraid to offend the great man, complied, how the weight bore him down,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>down into the earth;&rsquo; and she described a
circle with her finger on the ground, and bowed herself together to
represent the action; &lsquo;and he clung to the altar steps, but they
gave way like wax; and he sank lower and lower,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3744src" href="#xd21e3744" name="xd21e3744src">15</a> till he
called to the priest to take the fearful Host back from him.&rsquo;
&lsquo;And what became of him?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;He went into the
monastery of Stamms, and lived a life of penance. But his lady was
worse than he: when they told her what had taken place, she swore she
would not believe it; &ldquo;As well might you tell me,&rdquo; she
said, and stamped her foot, &ldquo;that that withered stalk could
produce a rose;&rdquo; and even as she spoke, three sweet roses burst
forth from the dry branch, which had been dead all the winter. Then the
proud lady, refusing to yield to the prodigy, rushed out of the house
raving mad, and was never seen there again; but by night you may yet
hear her wailing over the mountains, for there is no rest for
<i>her</i>.&rsquo; Her declamation and action accompanying every detail
was consummate.</p>
<p>I asked her if she knew no such stories of the neighbourhood of
Schwatz. She thought for a moment, and then assuming her excited manner
once more, she pointed to a neighbouring eminence. &lsquo;There was a
bird-catcher,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;who used to go out on the
<i lang="de">Goaslahn</i> there, following his birds; but he was quite
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>mad about his sport, and could not let it alone,
feast day or working day. One Sunday came, and he could not wait to
hear the holy Mass. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out for an hour or two,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be time for that yet.&rdquo; So he went
wandering through the woods, following his sport, and the hours flew
away as fast as the birds; hour by hour the church bell rang, but he
always said to himself he should be in time to catch the Mass of the
next hour. The nine o&rsquo;clock Mass was past, and the clock had
warned him that it was a quarter to ten, and he had little more than
time to reach the last Mass of the day. Just as he was hesitating to
pack up his tackle, a beautiful bird, such as he had never seen before,
with a gay red head, came hopping close to his decoy birds. It was not
to be resisted. The bird-catcher could not take his eye off the bird.
&ldquo;Dong!&rdquo; went the bell; hop! went the bird. Which should he
follow? The bird was so <i>very</i> near the lime now; there must be
time to secure him, and yet reach the church, at least before the
Gospel. At last, the final stroke of the bell sounded; and at the same
instant the beautiful bird hopped on to the snare. Who could throw away
so fair a chance? Then the glorious plumage must be carefully cleansed
of the bird-lime, which had assisted the capture, and the prize
secured, and carefully stowed away at home. It would be too late for
Mass then; and the bird-catcher felt the full reproach of the course he
was tempted to pursue, nevertheless he could not resist it. On he went,
homewards; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>now full of buoyant joy over his luck, now cast
down with shame and sorrow over his neglected duty. He had thus
proceeded a good part of his way, before he perceived that his burden
was getting heavier and heavier; at last he could hardly get along
under it. So he set it down, and began to examine into the cause. He
found that the strange bird had swelled out so big, that it was near
bursting the bars of its cage, while from its wings issued furious
sulphurous fumes. Then he saw how he had been deceived; that the
delusive form had been sent by the Evil One, to induce him to disobey
the command of the Church. Without hesitation he flung the cursed thing
from him, and watched it, by its trail of lurid flame, rolling down the
side of the Goaslahn. But never, from that day forward, did he again
venture to ply his trade on a holy day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such things had happened to others also,&rsquo; she said.
&lsquo;Hunters had been similarly led astray after strange chamois; for
the power of evil had many a snare for the weak. Birds too, though we
deemed them so pretty and innocent, were, more often than we thought,
the instruments of malice.&rsquo; And it struck me as she spoke, that
there were more crabbed stories of evil boding in her repertory than
gentle and holy ones. &lsquo;There is the swallow,&rsquo; she
instanced: &lsquo;why do swallows always hover over nasty dirty marshy
places? Don&rsquo;t you know that when the Saviour was hanging on the
Cross, and the earth trembled, and the sun grew dark <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>with
horror, and all the beasts of the field went and hid themselves for
shame, only the frivolous<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3769src" href=
"#xd21e3769" name="xd21e3769src">16</a> swallows flitted about under
the very shadow of the holy rood, and twittered their love songs as on
any ordinary day. Then the Saviour turned His head and reproached the
thoughtless birds; and mark my words, never will you see a swallow
perched upon anything green and fresh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was sorry to part from her and her legendary store; but I was
already due at the station, to meet friends by the train. She took my
alms with glee, and then pursued her upward way barefooted, to make
some promised orisons at the Freundsberg shrine.</p>
<p>It was a glowing afternoon; and after crossing the unshaded bridge
and meadows, to and from the railway, I was glad to stop and rest in a
little church which stood open, near the river. It was a plain
whitewashed edifice, ornamented with more devotion than taste. When I
turned to come away, I found that the west wall was perforated with a
screen of open iron-work, on the other side of which was an airy
hospital ward. The patients could by this means beguile their weary
hours with thoughts congenial to them suggested by the Tabernacle and
the Crucifix. A curtain hung by the side, which could be drawn across
the screen at pleasure. There were not more than four or five patients
in the ward at the time, and in most instances decay of nature was the
cause of disease. There is not much illness at Schwatz; but admittance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>to the simple accommodation of the hospital is
easily conceded. Schwatz formerly had two, but the larger was burnt
down in 1809. The remaining one seems amply sufficient for the needs of
the place.</p>
<p>There was &lsquo;Benediction&rsquo; in the church in the evening,
for it was, I forget what, saint&rsquo;s day. The church was very full,
and the people said the Rosary in common before the Office began. A
great number of the girls from the tobacco factory came in as they left
work, and the singing was unusually sweet, which surprised me, as the
Schwatzers are noted for their nasal twang and drawling accent in
speaking. I learnt that there are several Italians from
W&auml;lsch-Tirol settled here, and they lead the choir. It is edifying
to see the work-people, after their day&rsquo;s toil, coming into the
church as if it was more familiar to them even than home; but one does
not get used to seeing the uncovered heads of the women, though indeed
with the rich and luxuriant braids of hair with which Nature endows
them, they might be deemed &lsquo;covered&rsquo; enough.</p>
<p>A more familiar sight to an English eye is the seat-filled area of
the German churches. Confessedly it is one of the home associations
which one least cares to see reproduced, but the pews of the German
churches are less objectionable than our own; they are lower, and not
so crowded, and ample space is always left for processions, so they
interfere far less with the architectural design. <span class=

<p class="first">Falkenstein, which may be reached by a short walk from
Schwatz, is worth visiting on account of the information it affords as
to the mode of working adopted in the old mines both of silver and
copper. This was the locality where the greatest quantity of silver was
got; it was particularly noted also for the abundance and beauty of the
malachite, found in great variety and richness of tints; the turquoise
was found also, but more rarely. The old shaft runs first horizontally
for some two miles, and then sinks in two shafts to a depth of some two
hundred and thirty fathoms. The engineering and hydraulic works seem to
have been very ingenious, but the description of them does not come
within the sphere of my present undertaking. It does, however, to
observe that over this, as over everything else in Tirol, religion shed
its halo. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>The miners had ejaculatory prayers, which it was
their custom to utter as they passed in and out of their place of
subterranean toil; and an appropriate petition for every danger,
whether from fire-damp, land-slips, defective machinery, or other
cause. Their greeting to each other, and to those they met by the way,
in place of the national &lsquo;<span lang="de">Gelobt sei Jesus
Christus</span>,&rsquo; was &lsquo;<span lang="de">Gott gebe euch
Gl&uuml;ck und Segen!</span>&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3814src"
href="#xd21e3814" name="xd21e3814src">1</a> For their particular patron
they selected the Prophet Daniel, whose preservation in the rocky den
of the lions, as they had seen it portrayed, seemed to bear some
analogy with their own condition. Of their liberality in
church-building I have already spoken; but many are the churches and
chapels that bear the token&mdash;a crossed chisel and hammer on a red
field&mdash;of their contribution to its expense.</p>
<p>There are many other walks to be made from Schwatz. First there is
Buch, so called from the number of beech-trees in the neighbourhood,
which afford pleasant shade, and diversify the scenery, in which the
castle of Tratzberg across the Inn<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3819src"
href="#xd21e3819" name="xd21e3819src">2</a> also holds an important
part. Further on is Margareth, surrounded by rich pastures, which are
watered by the foaming Margarethenbach. Then to the south-east is
Galzein, with a number of dependent &lsquo;groups of houses,&rsquo;
particularly Kugelmoos, the view from which sweeps the Inn from
Kufstein to <span class="corr" id="xd21e3824" title=
"Source: Innbruck">Innsbruck</span>. Beyond, again, but further south,
is the Schwaderalpe, whence the iron worked and taken in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>dep&ocirc;t at Schwatz is got; and the
Kellerspitze, with the little village of Troi, its twelve houses
perched as if by supernatural handiwork on the spur of a rock, and once
nearly as prolific as Falkenstein in its yield of silver. The
exhausted&mdash;deaf (<i lang="de">taub</i>) as it is expressively
qualified in German&mdash;borings of S. Anthony and S. Blaze are still
sometimes explored by pedestrians.</p>
<p>Arzburg also is within an hour&rsquo;s walk. It was once rich in
copper ore, but is now comparatively little worked. Above it is the
<i lang="de">Heiligenkreuzkapelle</i>, about which it is told, that
when, on occasion of the <i lang="de">baierische-Rumpel</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3839src" href="#xd21e3839" name="xd21e3839src">3</a>
in 1703, the bridge of Zirl was destroyed, the cross which surmounted
it being carried away by the current, was here rescued and set up by
the country-people, who still honour it by frequent pilgrimages.</p>
<p>Starting again from Schwatz by the high-road, which follows pretty
nearly the course of the Inn, you pass a succession of small towns,
each of which heads a valley, to which it gives its name, receiving it
first from the torrent which through each pours the aggregate of the
mountain streams into the river, all affording a foot-way through the
Duxerthal into the further extremity of the Zillerthal&mdash;Pill,
Weer, Kolsass, Wattens, and Volders.</p>
<p>First, there is Pill, a frequent name in Tirol, and derived by Weber
from <i lang="de">B&uuml;hl</i> or <i lang="de">B&uuml;chl</i>, a
knoll; it is the wildest and most enclosed of any of these lateral
valleys, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>and exposed to the ravages of the torrent, which
often in winter carries away both bridges and paths, and makes its
recesses inaccessible even to the hardy herdsmen. The following story
may serve to show <i>how</i> hardy they are:&mdash;Three sons of a
peasant, whose wealth consisted in his grazing rights over a certain
tract of the neighbouring slopes, were engaged one day in gathering
herbage along the steep bank for the kids of their father&rsquo;s
flock. The steep must have been difficult indeed on which they were
afraid to trust mountain kids to cater for themselves; and the youngest
of the boys was but six, the eldest only fifteen. The eldest lost his
balance, and was precipitated into the roaring torrent, just then
swollen to unusual proportions; he managed to cling fast behind one of
the rocky projections which mark its bed, but his strength was utterly
unable to bear him out of the stream. The second brother, aged ten,
without hesitating, embraced the risk of almost certain death, let
himself down the side of the precipice by clinging to the scanty roots
which garnished its almost perpendicular side. Arrived at the bottom,
he sprang with the lightness of a chamois across the foaming waters on
to the rock where the boy was now slackening his exhausted hold, and
succeeded in dragging him up on to the surface; but even there there
seemed no chance of help, far out of sound as they were of all human
ears. But the youngest, meantime, with a thoughtfulness beyond his
years, had made his way home alone, and apprised the father, who
readily found the means of rescuing his offspring. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>The break into the Weerthal is at some little distance from the high
road; its church, situated on a little high-level plain, is surrounded
with fir-trees. A little lake is pointed out, of which a similar legend
is told to &lsquo;the judgment of Achensee,&rsquo; which is indeed one
not infrequently met with; it is said that it covers a spot where stood
a mighty castle, once submerged for the haughtiness of its inhabitants,
and the waters placed there that no one might again build on the site
for ever. The greatest ornament of the valley is the rambling ruin of
Schloss Rettenberg, on its woody height, once a fortress of the
Rottenburgers; afterwards it passed to Florian Waldauf, whose history I
have already given when speaking of Hall.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3860src" href="#xd21e3860" name="xd21e3860src">4</a> It was
bought by the commune in 1810, and the present church built up out of
the materials it afforded, the former church having been burnt down
that year. The old site and its remains are looked upon by the people
as haunted by a steward of the castle and his wife, who in the days of
its prosperity dealt hardly with the widow and the orphan, and must now
wander sighing and breathing death on all who come within their baleful
influence. A shepherd once fell asleep in the noontide heat, while his
sheep were browsing on the grass-grown eminence. When he woke, they
were no longer in sight; at last he found them dead within the castle
keep. &lsquo;Guard thy flock better,&rsquo; shouted a hoarse voice,
&lsquo;for this enclosure is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href=
"#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>mine, and none who come hither
escape me.&rsquo; None ventured within the precincts after this; but
many a time those who were bold enough to peep through a fissure in the
crazy walls reported that they had seen the hard-hearted steward as a
pale, weary, grey-bearded man, sit sighing on the crumbling stones.</p>
<p>The Kolsassthal merges into the Weerthal and is hardly distinguished
from it, and affords a sort of counterpart, though on more broken
ground, to the Gnadenwald on the opposite side of the river. It is from
this abundance of shady woods that its name is derived, through the old
German <i lang="de">kuol</i>, cool, and <i lang="de">sazz</i>, a
settlement. In the church, the altar-piece of the Assumption is by
Zoller. The church of Wattens has an altar-piece by a more esteemed
Tirolean artist, Sch&ouml;pf; it represents S. Laurence, to whom the
church is dedicated. The many forges busily at work making implements
of agriculture, nails, &amp;c., keep you well aware of the thrift and
industry of the place; its prosperity is further supported by a paper
manufactory, which has always remained in the hands of the family which
started it in 1559, and supplies the greater part of Tirol. A
self-taught villager, Joseph Schwaighofer, enjoyed some reputation here
a few years ago as a guitar maker. The Wattenserthal, like the
Kolsassthal, is also very woody, and contains some little settlements
of charcoal-burners; but it is also diversified by a great many fertile
glades, which are diligently sought out for pasture. At Walchen, where
a few shepherds&rsquo; huts are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206"
href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>clustered at the confluence
of two mountain streams, the valley is broken into two
branches&mdash;one, M&ouml;ls, running nearly due south into the
Navisthal, by paths increasing in difficulty as you proceed; the other,
Lizumthal, by the south-east to Hinterdux, passing at the Innerlahn the
so-called &lsquo;Blue Lake,&rsquo; of considerable depth.<a class=

<p>Following the road again, Volders is reached at about a mile from
Wattens. As at the latter place, your ears are liberally greeted with
the sounds of the smithy. Volders has quite a celebrity for its
production of scythes; some ten or twelve thousand are said to be
exported annually. The Post Inn affords tolerable quarters for a night
or two while exploring the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The prolific pencil of Sch&ouml;pf has provided the church with an
altar-piece of the Holy Family; though an ancient foundation, it does
not present any object of special interest.</p>
<p>The Voldererthal runs beneath some peaks dear to Alpine climbers,
the Grafmarterspitz, the Glunggeser, the Kreuzjoch, and the Pfunerjoch.
Its entrance is commanded by the castles of Hanzenheim, sometimes
called Starkelberg, from having belonged to a family of that name, and
used as a hospital during the campaign <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>of 1809; and
Friedberg, which is still inhabited, having been carefully restored by
the present owner, Count Albert von Cristalnigg. It was originally
built in the ninth or tenth century, as a tower to guard the bridge; it
gave its name to a powerful family, who are often mentioned in the
history of Tirol. At the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the
fourteenth centuries, it was one of the castles annexed by Friedrich
<i lang="de">mit der leeren Tasche</i>. It contains also the
Voldererbad, a mineral spring, which is much visited, but more
conveniently reached by way of Windegg than through the valley
itself.</p>
<p>In the Voldererwald is a group of houses, Aschbach by name, which
belongs ecclesiastically to the parish of Mils, on the opposite side;
and the following story is given to account for the anomaly:&mdash;At
the time when the territory of Volders belonged parochially to Kolsass
(it must have been before the year 1630, as it was that year formed
into an independent parish), the neighbourhood was once ravaged by the
plague. A farmer of Aschbach being stricken by it, sent to beg the
spiritual assistance of the priest of Kolsass. The priest attended to
the summons; but when he reached the threshold of the infected
dwelling, and saw what a pitiable sight the sick man presented, his
fears got the better of his resolution, and he could not prevail on
himself to enter the room. Not to leave his penitent entirely without
comfort, however, he exhorted him to repentance, heard his confession,
and absolved him from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href=
"#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>where he stood; and then
uncovering the sacred Host, bid him gaze on it in a spirit of faith,
and assured him he should thereby receive all the benefit of actual
Communion. The visit thus completed, he hurried back to Kolsass in all
speed. Meantime the sick man, not satisfied with the office thus
performed, sent for the priest of Mils, who, supported by apostolic
charity, approached him without hesitation, and administered the sacred
mysteries. Contrary to all expectation, the farmer recovered, resumed
his usual labours, and in due course garnered his harvest. In due
course also came round the season for paying his tithe. With
commendable punctuality the farmer loaded his waggon with the sacred
tribute, and started alacritously on the way to Kolsass. Any one who
watched him might have observed a twinkle of his eye, which portended
some unusual d&eacute;nouement to the yearly journey. As he approached
Kolsass the twinkle kindled more humorously, and the oxen felt the goad
applied more vigorously. The pastor of Kolsass turned out to see the
waggon approaching at the unusual pace, and was already counting the
tempting sheaves of golden corn. To his surprise, however, his
frolicsome parishioner wheeled round his team before he brought it to a
stand, and then cried aloud, &lsquo;Gaze, Father! yes, gaze in faith on
the goodly sight, and believe me, your faith shall stand you in stead
of the actual fruition!&rsquo; With that he drove his waggon at the
same pace at which he had come, straight off to the pastor of Mils, at
whose worthy feet he laid the tithe. And this act of &lsquo;poetical
justice&rsquo; was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209"
name="pb209">209</a>]</span>ratified by ecclesiastical authority as a
censure on the pusillanimity of the priest of Kolsass, by the transfer
of the tithing of Aschbach to the parish of Mils. I have met a
counterpart of this story both in England and in Spain; so true is it,
as Carlyle has prettily said, that though many traditions have but one
root they grow, like the banyan, into a whole overarching
labyrinth.</p>
<p>The stately <i lang="de">Serviten-kloster</i> outside Volders
suggests another adaptation of this metaphor. From the root of one
saint&rsquo;s maxims and example, what an &lsquo;over-arching
labyrinth&rsquo; of good works will grow up and spread over and adorn
the face of the earth, even in the most distant parts. In the year 1590
there was born at Trent a boy named Hyppolitus Guarinoni, who was
destined to graft upon Tirol the singular virtues of St. Charles
Borromeo. Attached early to the household of the saintly Archbishop of
Milan, Guarinoni grew up to embody in action his spirit of devotion and
charity. By St. Charles&rsquo;s advice and assistance he followed the
study of medicine, and took his degree in his twenty-fifth year.
Shortly after, he was appointed physician in ordinary to the then ruler
of Tirol, Archduke Ferdinand II. His fervent piety marked him as
specially fit to be further entrusted with the sanitary care of the
convent founded some years before by the Princesses Magdalen, Margaret,
and Helena, Ferdinand&rsquo;s sisters, at Hall, and called the <i lang=
"de">K&ouml;nigliche Damenstift</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3907src" href="#xd21e3907" name="xd21e3907src">6</a> All the time
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>was left free by these public engagements he
spent by the bedsides of the poor of the neighbourhood. The care of the
soul ever accompanied his care for their bodies, and many a wanderer
owed his reconciliation with heaven to his timely exhortations. Just
about this time the incursions of the new doctrines were making
themselves felt in this part of Tirol, and some localities, which from
their remoteness were out of the way of regular parochial
ministrations, were beginning to listen to them. Guarinoni discovered
this in the course of his charitable labours, for which no outlying
<i lang="de">Sennerh&uuml;tte</i> was inaccessible. In 1628 he obtained
special leave, though a layman, from the Bishop of Brixen, to preach in
localities which had no resident pastor; he further published a little
work which he used to distribute among the people, designed to show
them how many corporal infirmities are induced by neglect of the
whole-some maxims of religion. Besides the restored unity of the faith
in his country, two other monuments of his piety remain: the Church of
St. Charles by the bridge of Volders, and the Sanctuary of Judenstein.
In his moments of leisure it was his favourite occupation to commit to
writing for the instruction of posterity the traditional details of the
life of St. Nothburga, and of the holy child Andreas of Rinn, which
were at his date <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211"
name="pb211">211</a>]</span>even more rife in the mouths of the
peasantry of the neighbourhood than at present. He only died in 1654,
having devoted himself to these good works for nearly half a
century.</p>
<p>The church by which he endeavoured to bring under observation and
imitation the distinguishing qualities of St. Charles, was erected on a
spot famous in the Middle Ages as a bandit&rsquo;s den; the building
occupied thirty-four years, and was consecrated but a short time before
his death. Baron Karl von Fieger, from whom he bought the site, a few
years later added to it the Servite monastery, which, though it
exhibits all the vices of the architecture of its date, yet bears
tokens that its imperfections are not due to any stint of means. Its
three cupolas and other structural arrangements are designed in
commemoration of the Holy Trinity&mdash;a mystery which is held in very
special honour throughout Austria. In the decorations, later
benefactors have carried on Guarinoni&rsquo;s intention, the acts of
St. Charles being portrayed in the frescoes, completed in 1764, by
which Knoller has earned some celebrity in the world of art for himself
and for the church: they display his conversion from the stiffer German
style of his master, Paul Trogger, to the Italian manner. That over the
entrance conveys a tradition of St. Charles, predicting to Guarinoni,
while his page, that he would one day erect a church in his honour;
that of the larger cupola is an apotheosis of the saint. The picture of
the high-altar sets forth the saint ministering <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>to
the plague-stricken; it is Knoller&rsquo;s boldest attempt at
colouring.</p>
<p>Near the entrance door may be observed a considerable piece of rock
built into the wall, entitled by the people &lsquo;<i lang="de">Stein
des Gehorsams</i>,<span class="corr" id="xd21e3929" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3931src"
href="#xd21e3931" name="xd21e3931src">7</a> its history being that at
the time when the church was building it was detached from the rock
above by a landslip, and threatened the workmen with destruction. Its
course was arrested at the behest of a pious monk, who was overseeing
the works.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3934src" href="#xd21e3934" name=
"xd21e3934src">8</a></p>
<p>After passing the Servitenkloster a footpath may easily be found
which leads to Judenstein and Rinn, the seat of one of the
much-contested medi&aelig;val beliefs accusing the Jews of the
sacrifice of Christian children. It may be better, in describing this
stem of this banyan, to visit Rinn the further place first, and take
Judenstein on our way back. The country traversed is well wooded, and
further diversified by the bizarre outlines of the steeples of Hall
seen across the river, while the mighty Glunggeser-Spitz rises 7,500
feet above you. It invites a visit for its amenity and its
associations, though the relics of the infant Saint
&lsquo;Anderle&rsquo; are no longer there. His father died, it would
seem, while he was a child in arms; his mother earned her living in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>fields, and while she was absent used to leave
her boy at Pentzenhof in charge of his godfather, Mayr. One day, when
he was about three years old&mdash;it was the 12th July 1462&mdash;she
was cutting corn, when suddenly she saw three drops of blood upon her
hand without any apparent means of accounting for the token, one with
which many superstitions were connected.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3944src" href="#xd21e3944" name="xd21e3944src">9</a> Her motherly
instincts were alarmed, and, without an instant&rsquo;s consideration,
she threw down her sickle and hurried home. A little field-chapel to
St. Isidor the husbandman, St. Nothburga, and St. Andrew of Rinn, was
subsequently built upon this spot. Arrived at Mayr&rsquo;s house, the
forebodings of her anxious heart were redoubled at not finding her
darling playing about as he was wont. The faithless godfather, taken by
surprise at her unexpected return, only stammered broken excuses in
answer to her reiterated inquiries. At last he exclaimed, thinking to
calm her frenzy, &lsquo;If he is not here, here is something
better&mdash;a hat full of golden pieces, which we will share between
us.&rsquo; He took down his hat, but to his consternation instead of
finding it heavy with its golden contents, there was nothing in it but
withered leaves! At this sight he was overcome with fear and horror;
his speech forsook him, and his senses together, and he ended his days
raving mad. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>The distracted mother, meantime, pursued her inquiries and
perquisitions; but all she could learn was that certain Jews,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3963src" href="#xd21e3963" name=
"xd21e3963src">10</a> returning from their harvesting at Botzen, had
over-tempted Mayr by their offers and persuaded him to sell the child
to them, but with the assurance that he should come to no harm. Little
reassured by the announcement, she ran madly into the neighbouring
birchwood, whither she had learned they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>had bent their steps,
and there came upon the lifeless body of her treasure, hanging
bloodless and mangled from a tree. A large stone near bore traces of
having been used as a sacrificial stone, and the clothes, which had
been rudely torn off, lay scattered about; the many wounds of his
tender form showed by how cruel a martyrdom he had been called to share
in the massacre of the Innocents.</p>
<p>His remains were tenderly gathered and laid to rest, and his memory
held in affection by all the neighbourhood; nevertheless, though there
were many signs of the supernatural connected with the event, it did
not receive all the veneration it might have been expected to call
forth.</p>
<p>About ten years later a similar event occurred at Trent, and the
remains of the infant S. Simeon were treated with so great honour that
the people of Rinn were awakened to an appreciation of the treasure
they had suffered to lie in their churchyard almost unheeded.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3984src" href="#xd21e3984" name=
"xd21e3984src">11</a> The Emperor <span class="corr" id="xd21e3987"
title="Source: Maxmilian">Maximilian</span> I. contemplated building a
church over the spot where the martyrdom <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e3990" title="Source: occured">occurred</span>, hence call
Judenstein. His intentions were frustrated by the knavery of the
builder, and only a small chapel was built at this time; and though on
occasion of its consecration the relics of the child martyr were
carried thither in solemn procession, they were still for some time
after preserved at Rinn. It was Hippolitus <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>Gruarinoni to whom the honour is due of saving
the spot from oblivion. The chisel of the Tirolese sculptor Nissl has
set forth in grotesque design a group of Jews fulfilling their fearful
deed. A portrait of Gruarinoni was likewise hung up there. The relics
were translated thither with due solemnity in 1678. An afflux of
pilgrims was immediately attracted, and the numerous tablets which
crowd the walls attest the estimation in which it has been held. Then
the people began to remember the wonders that had surrounded it. The
ghost of Godfather Mayr, which for two centuries had been frequently
met howling through the woods, now seemed to have found its rest, for
it was never more seen or heard. And they recalled how a beautiful
white lily, with strange letters on its petals, had bloomed
spontaneously on the holy infant&rsquo;s grave;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3995src" href="#xd21e3995" name="xd21e3995src">12</a> that when a
wilful boy, P&ouml;gler by name, snapped the stem while they were still
pondering what the unknown letters might mean, he had his arm withered;
and further that for generations after, every P&ouml;gler had died an
untimely or a violent death. How in like manner, for seven consecutive
winters, the birch-tree, on which the innocent child&rsquo;s body was
hung by his persecutors, put forth fresh green sprouts as if in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>spring, and how when a thoughtless woodman one
day hewed it down for a common tree, it happened that he met with a
terrible accident on his homeward way, whereof he died. It may well be
imagined that where such legends prevailed Jews obtained little favour;
so that to the present day it is said there is but few Jew families
settled among them, though they are numerous and influential in other
parts of the Austrian dominion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4010src"
href="#xd21e4010" name="xd21e4010src">13</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another memory yet of Hippolitus Guarinoni lingers in the
neighbourhood. By a path which branches off near Judenstein to the left
(going <i>from</i> Volders and following the stream), the Volderbad is
reached; a sulphur spring discovered and brought into notice by him,
and now much frequented in summer, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219"
href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>perhaps as much for its
pleasant mountain breezes as for the medicinal properties of the
waters.</p>
<p>There is another interesting excursion which should be followed
before reaching Innsbruck, but it is more easily made from Hall than
from Volders, though still on the right bank of the Inn. The first
village on it is Ampass, a walk of about four miles from Hall through
the most charming scenery; it is so called simply as being situated on
a pass between the hills traversed on the road to Hall. Then you pass
the remains of the former seat of the house of Brandhausen; and
following the road cut by Maria Theresa through the Wippthal to
facilitate the commerce in wine and salt between Matrei and Hall, you
pass Altrans and Lans, having always the green heights of the
Patscherkofl smiling before you, an easy ascent for those who desire to
practise climbing, from Lans, where the <i lang="de">Wilder
<span class="corr" id="xd21e4143" title="Source: Man">Mann</span></i>
affords possible quarters for a night.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4146src" href="#xd21e4146" name="xd21e4146src">14</a> A path
branching off from the Mattrei road leads hence to Sistrans, a village
whose church boasts of having been embellished by Claudia de&rsquo;
Medici. Its situation is delightful; the green plain is strewed with
fifteen towns and villages, including Hall and Innsbruck, and behind
these rise the great range of alps, while on the immediate foreground
is the tiny <span class="corr" id="xd21e4149" title=
"Source: Lanserse">Lansersee</span> which will afford excellent
<i lang="de">Forellen</i> for luncheon. The bed of this same Lansersee,
it is said, was once covered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href=
"#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>with a flourishing though not
extensive forest, its wood the only substance of a humble peasant, who
had received it from his fathers. A nobleman living near took a fancy
to the bit of forest ground, but instead of offering to purchase it, he
endeavoured to set up some obsolete claim in a court of law. The judge,
afraid to offend the powerful lord, decided in his favour. The poor man
heard the sentence with as much grief at the dishonour done to his
forefathers&rsquo; honour as distress at his own ruin. &lsquo;There is
no help for me on earth, I know,&rsquo; said the poor man. &lsquo;I
have no money to make an appeal. I may not contend in arms with one of
noble blood. But surely He who sitteth in heaven, and who avenged
Naboth, will not suffer this injustice. As for me, my needs are few; I
refuse not to work; the sweat of my brow will bring me bread enough;
but the inheritance of my fathers which I have preserved faithfully as
I received it from them, shall it pass to another?&rsquo; and in the
bitterness of his soul he wept and fell asleep; but as he slept in
peace a mighty roaring sound disturbed the slumbers of the unjust
noble; it seemed to him in his dream as though the foundations of his
castle were shattered and the floods passing over them. When they awoke
in the morning the forest was no more to be seen&mdash;a clear calm
lake mirrored the justice of heaven, and registered its decree that the
trees of the poor man should never enrich the store of his unscrupulous
neighbour. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sistrans was once famous for a champion wrestler who had long
carried off the palm from all the country round; but like him of
Schwatz, he was not content with his great natural strength; he was
always afraid a stronger than he might arise and conquer him in turn;
and so he determined to put himself beyond the reach of another&rsquo;s
challenge. To effect this he arranged with great seeming devotion to
serve the Mass on Christmas night; and while the priest&rsquo;s eye was
averted, laid a second wafer upon the one that he had had laid ready.
The priest, suspecting nothing, consecrated as usual; and then at the
moment of the <i lang="de">Wandlung</i>, when the priest was absorbed
in the solemnity of his act, as he approached to lift the chasuble he
stealthily abstracted the Host he had surreptitiously laid on the
altar. The precious talisman carefully concealed, he bound it on his
arm the instant Mass was over; and from that day forth no one could
stand against him. And not only this, but he had power too in a
multitude of other ways. Had anyone committed a theft, it needed but to
consult our wrestler; if he began saying certain words and walking
solemnly along, immediately, step by step, were he far or near, the
thief, wherever he was, was bound by secret and resistless impulse to
tread as he trod, and bring back the booty to the place whence he had
taken it. Was anyone&rsquo;s cattle stricken with sickness, it needed
but to call our wrestler; a few words solemnly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>pronounced, and the touch of his potent arm,
sufficed to restore the beast to perfect health. Moreover, no bird
could escape his snare, no fox or hare or chamois outrun him for
swiftness.</p>
<p>Thus all went well; he had played a bold stake, and had won his
game. But at last the time came for him to die. Weary of his struggles,
and even of his successes, our wrestler would fain have laid his head
to rest under the soft green turf of the field of peace, by the wayside
of those who pass in to pray, and lulled by the sound of the holy
bells. But in vain he lay in his bed; death came not. True, there were
all his symptoms in due force&mdash;the glazed eye and palsied tongue
and wringing agony; but for all that he could not die. At last, the
priest, astonished at what he saw, asked him if he had not on his
conscience some sin weighty above the wont, and so moved him to a sense
of penance that he confessed his impiety with tears of contrition; and
it was not till he had told all, and the priest had received the sacred
particle he had misused, that, shriven and blessed, his soul could
depart in peace. There is a spot outside Sistrans called the <i lang=
"de">Tods&uuml;nden-marterle</i>, but whether it has any connection
with this tradition, or whether it has one of its own, I have not been
able to learn.</p>
<p>A couple of hours further is the pilgrimage chapel of
Heiligenwasser, which is much visited both by the pious and the
valetudinarian. Its history is that in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>1606 two shepherd
boys keeping their father&rsquo;s herd upon the mountains lost two
young kine. In vain they sought them through the toilful path and
beneath the burning sun; the kine were nowhere to be found. At last in
despair of any further labour proving successful, they fell on their
knees and prayed with tears for help from above. Then a bright light
fell upon them, and the <i lang="de">Gnadenmutter</i> appeared beside
them, and bid them be of good cheer, for the cattle were gone home to
their stall; moreover she added, &lsquo;Drink, children, for the day is
hot, and ye are weary with wandering.&rsquo; &lsquo;Drink!&rsquo;
exclaimed the famished children, &lsquo;where shall we find water?
there is no water near!&rsquo; but even as they spoke the <i lang=
"de">Gnadenmutter</i> was taken from their sight, but in the place
where the light surrounding her had shone there welled up a clear and
bubbling stream between the rocks, which has never ceased to flow
since. The boys went home, but had not the courage to tell how great a
favour had been bestowed on them; yet they never went by that way
without turning to give glory to God, and say a prayer beneath the holy
spring.</p>
<p>Fifty years passed. One of them was an infirm old man, and no longer
went abroad so far, the other was attended in his labours by the son of
a neighbour, a lad who had been dumb from his birth. When the lad saw
the herdsman kneel down by the spring and drink and pray, he knelt and
drank and prayed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224"
name="pb224">224</a>]</span>too; when lo! no sooner had the water
passed his lips than he found he had the power of speech like any
other. The narration of the one wonder led to that of the other. The
people readily believed, and before the year was out a chapel had been
raised upon the spot. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href=

strong is the prejudice in Tirol against Jews, that it is said to be
most difficult to find any one who will consent to act the part of
Judas in the Passion plays.</p>
<p class="footnote">There is a very strong personal dislike to Judas
throughout Tirol, and I have also heard that the custom of burning him
in effigy occurs in various places. Karl Blind, in the article quoted
above, (p. 3,) accounts for this custom in the following way:
&lsquo;After the appearance of fermenting matter it was said&rsquo; (in
what he calls the germanic mythology) &lsquo;that there rose in course
of time&mdash;even as in Greek mythology&mdash;first a half-human,
half-divine race of giants, and then a race of Gods; the Gods had to
wage war against the giants and finally vanquished them. Evidently the
giants represent a torpid barren state of things in nature, whilst the
Gods signify the sap and fulness of life which struggles into distinct
and beautiful form. There was a custom among the Germanic tribes of
celebrating this victory over the uncouth Titans by a festival, when a
gigantic doll was carried round in Guy Fawkes manner and at last burnt.
To this day there are traces of the heathen practice. In some parts of
Europe, so-called Judas-fires, which have their origin in the burning
of the doll which represented the giants or j&ouml;tun. In some places,
owing to another perversion of things and words, people run about on
that f&ecirc;te-day shouting &lsquo;burn the old Jew!&rsquo; The
<i lang="de">j&ouml;tun</i> was in fact, when Christianity came in,
first converted into Judas and then into a Jew, a transition to which
the similarity of the sound of the words easily lent itself.&rsquo; No
doubt <i lang="de">j&ouml;tun</i> sounds very like <i lang=
"de">Juden</i> but not all coincidences are consequences, and it is
quite possible that the old heathen custom had quite died out before
that of burning Judas in effigy began, as it certainly had before Guy
Fawkes began to be so treated. The same treatment of Judas&rsquo;
memory occurs, too, in Spain on the day before Good Friday.</p>

<p class="first">I shall not easily forget my first greeting at
Innsbruck. We had come many days&rsquo; journey from the north to a
rendezvous with friends who had travelled many days&rsquo; journey from
the south; they were to arrive a week earlier than we, and were
accordingly to meet us at the station and do the hosts&rsquo; part. But
it happened that the station was being rebuilt, and the order of
&lsquo;No admittance except on business&rsquo; was strictly enforced.
The post-office was closed, being &lsquo;after hours,&rsquo; and though
the man left in charge, with true Tirolean urbanity, suffered us to
come in and turn over the letters for ourselves, we failed to find the
one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>conveying the directions we sought. So with no
fixed advices to guide us, we wandered through the mountain capital in
search of a chance meeting. We had nearly given up this attempt in its
turn in despair of success, when &lsquo;Albina,&rsquo; a little white
Roman <i lang="it">lupetto</i> dog, belonging to the friends of whom we
were in search, came bounding upon me. It was more than two years since
I had taken leave of her in the Eternal City, but her affectionate
sympathy was stronger than time or distance; and here, far from all aid
in the associations of home, and while the rest of her party were yet a
great way off&mdash;almost out of sight&mdash;she had spied me out, and
came to give her true and hearty greeting.</p>
<p>It is a pleasant association <i>with</i> Innsbruck, a revelation of
that pure and lasting love which dog-nature seems to have been
specially created to convey; but it was not <i>of</i> Innsbruck.
Innsbruck&mdash;<i lang="de">Schpruck</i>, as the indigenous call
it&mdash;though the chief, is the least Tirolean town of Tirol. It apes
the airs and vices of a capital, without having the magnificence and
convenience by which they are engendered.</p>
<p>There is a page of Tirol&rsquo;s history blotted by a deed which
Innsbruck alone, of all Tirol, could have committed, and which it
indeed requires its long and otherwise uniformly high character for
both exceeding hospitality and exceeding loyalty to cancel. The subject
of it was its own Kaiser Max, whose prudence in governmental details
and gallantry in the field and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227"
href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>in the chase had raised him
in the popular mind to the position of a hero. When he had come to them
before, in his youth, in his might, and in his imperial pomp, he had
been sung and f&ecirc;ted. The people had acclaimed him with joy, and
his deeds were a very household epic; while he in turn had extended
their borders by conquest, and their privileges by concessions. But now
he had come back to them, worn out with war and cares and age. He felt
that his end was near, and it was to Tirol, with which he had always
stood in bonds of so much love, that he turned to spend his few
declining years. But Innsbruck, when it saw him thus, seems to have
forgotten his prowess and his benefits, and to have remembered only a
pitiful squabble about payment of the score for the maintenance of his
household at his last visit. A ruler who had spent himself in bettering
the condition of his people might well, in the days of his weariness
and sadness of heart, have expected to meet with more liberality at
their hands; but from Innsbruck, where&mdash;little obscure provincial
town as it was&mdash;he had so often held his court, which had been
raised in importance and singularly enriched by royal marriages and
receptions and other costly ceremonies celebrated there at his desire,
and which by his example and instigation had become the residence of
many nobles who had learnt under his administration to value peaceful
study above the pursuit of war&mdash;from Innsbruck he had most of all
to expect. And yet on this occasion, as he lay ailing and restless on
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>couch, the neighing and tramping of his horses
disturbed his fitful slumbers; and rising in the early dawn to
ascertain the cause, he beheld the team which had brought him from the
Diet at Augsburg, left out unfed and untended in the streets, because
the people said he should not run up another score with them. With a
moderation he would not perhaps have practised in his younger days, he
quietly went on his way, to die at Wels on the Trann.</p>
<p>I have often pictured the pale sad face of the old Emperor as he
turned from that sight, and thought of the sickness of his heart as one
of history&rsquo;s most touching lessons of the world&rsquo;s
inconstancy. Perhaps it predisposed me against Innsbruck; perhaps I was
inclined to be a little unjust; but, at all events, it prepared me not
to be surprised if its people should prove more sophisticated than
their fellow-countrymen. It was quite what I expected, therefore, when
I was told that in the older inns of the class wherein one generally
finds a refreshing hospitality and primitiveness, the absence of
comfort was not compensated by corresponding simplicity of manners.</p>
<p>In the <span class="corr" id="xd21e4244" title=
"Source: Oesterreichisher">Oesterreichischer</span> Hof, one of those
provincial pieces of pretentiousness which those who travel to learn
the characteristics of a country should, under ordinary circumstances,
avoid, we found the pleasantness of its situation sufficient to make us
forget all else; and indeed, considered as a copy of a Vienna hotel, it
is not a bad attempt. There is a room which on Sundays <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>is
set apart for an English service. On a subsequent visit we found a
large new hotel (Europa), rather near the railway station, preferable
to it in some respects, and there are many others besides.</p>
<p>I have spoken of the pleasant situation, and our apartment was
situated so as fully to enjoy it; we had to ourselves a whole suite of
little rooms, with a separate corridor running along the back of them,
from the windows of which we could make acquaintance, under the
alternating play of sunshine, moonbeam, or lightning, with the range of
mountains which wall in Tirol. The Martinswand and Frauh&uuml;tt, with
their romantic memories; the Seegruben-spitze and the Kreuz-spitze,
rugged and wild; the grand masses of the Brandjoch and the lesser
Solstein, and the greater Solstein already wearing a lace-like veil of
snow; while the quaint copper cupolaed towers of Innsbruck conceal the
Rumerjoch and the <span class="corr" id="xd21e4251" title=
"Source: Kaisersa&uuml;le">Kaisers&auml;ule</span>; and in the front of
the picture, the roofs with their wooden tiles afford a view of the
mysteries of apple-drying, and a thousand other local arts of domestic
economy. If our furniture was not of the most elegant or abundant, it
was all the more in keeping with such wild surroundings.</p>
<p>The character of the town itself partakes of the same mixture of
quaint picturesqueness with modern pretension which I have already
observed in that of the people and the hotel. The <i lang=
"de">Neustadt</i>, as the chief street is called, remarkable for its
width, tidiness, and good paving, is no less so for its old arcades in
one part, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>and the steep gables in another, and the
monuments of faith which adorn its centre line. At one end it is closed
in by the stern gaunt mountain, at the other by Maria Theresa&rsquo;s
triumphal arch. There are other streets again, straight, modern, and
uniform; the Museum Strasse, and the Karl Strasse, and the Landhaus
Gasse,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4261src" href="#xd21e4261" name=
"xd21e4261src">1</a> but you soon come to an end of them; and then you
find yourself in a suburb of most primitive quality; your progress
arrested, now by the advance of the iron road, now by the placid gentle
Sill, now by the proudly flowing Inn. The medi&aelig;val history of
Innsbruck is signalized by a number of fires which destroyed many of
its antiquities. To the first of these it owes the suggestion that the
town needed a water supply, acted upon by Meinhard II., and the monks
of Wilten, in the formation of the <i lang="de">Kleine Sill</i>, which
continues still as useful as ever; but other fires again and again laid
it in ashes, so that very little of really old work survives, though
there are many foundations of early date, the buildings of which have
been again and again rebuilt. The very oldest of these is the monastery
of Wilten, now a suburb a little way outside the <i lang=
"de">Triumphpforte</i>, originally the seat of the suzerains who
created the town.</p>
<p>The history of its origin is one of the most remarkable myths of the
country, and is a very epitome of the history of the conflict of
Heathendom with Christendom. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Romans had found here a flourishing town even in their time, and
they made of it an important station, calling it Valdidena, whence its
present name; coins and other relics of their sojourn are continually
dug out of the soil. Tradition has it, however, that Etzel (Attila)
laid the city in ruins on his way back from the terrible battle of
Chalons. It continued, nevertheless, to be a convenient and
consequently frequented station of the intercourse between the banks of
the Po and the Rhine. When Dietrich von Bern (Theodoric of Verona)
announced his expedition against Chriemhilde&rsquo;s Garden of Roses at
Worms, one of the mightiest who responded to his appeal, and who did
him the most signal service in taking the Rose-garden, was Heime,
popularly called Haymon, a giant &lsquo;taller and more powerful than
Goliath.&rsquo; Returning in Theodoric&rsquo;s victorious train, he
came through Tirol. As he approached Valdidena he found his passage
barred by another giant named Thyrsus, living near Zirl, who has left
his name to the little neighbouring hamlet of Tirschenbach. Thyrsus had
heard of Haymon&rsquo;s prowess, and as his own had been unchallenged
hitherto, he determined to provoke him to combat. Haymon was no less
fierce than himself, and scarcely waited for his challenge to rush to
the attack. But anyone who had looked on would have guessed from the
first moment on which side the advantage would fall. Thyrsus was indeed
terrible of aspect; higher in stature than Haymon, his shaggy hair
covered a determined brow; his hardy <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>skin was bronzed by
exposure to weather and lying on the rocks; his sinews were developed
by constant use, and their power attested by the tree torn up by the
roots which he bore in his hand for a club; at each footfall the ground
shook, for he planted his feet with a sound of thunder, and his stride
was from hill to hill. But Haymon&rsquo;s every movement displayed him
practised in each art of attack and defence. Less fierce of expression
than Thyrsus, his eyes were ever on the watch to follow every moment of
his antagonist, and like a wall of adamant he stood receiving all his
thrusts with a studied patience, giving back none till his
attacker&rsquo;s strength was well-nigh exhausted. <i>Then</i> he fell
upon him and slew him. An effigy of the two giants yet adorns the wall
of the wayside chapel at Tirschendorf.</p>
<p>Haymon was still in the prime of manhood, being about thirty-five,
and this was but one of his many successful combats. Nevertheless, it
was destined to be his last, for a Benedictine monk of Tegernsee coming
by while he was yet in the first flush of victory, succeeded so well in
reasoning with him on the worthlessness of all on which he had hitherto
set his heart, and on the superior attractions of a higher life, that
he then and there determined to give up his sanguinary career, and
henceforth devote his strength to the service of Christ.</p>
<p>In pursuance of this design he determined to build with his own
hands a church and monastery on the site of the ruined town of
Valdidena, by the banks of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233"
href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>Sill. With his own hands he
quarried the stone and felled the timber; but in the meantime the Evil
One in the form of a huge dragon had taken possession of the place.
Never did he let himself be seen; but when he came to lay the
foundation, Haymon found every morning that whatever work he had done
by day, the dragon had destroyed by night. Then he saw that he must
watch by night as well as work by day, and by this means he discovered
with what manner of adversary he had to deal. The dragon lashed the
ground with his tail in fury, just as the wild wind stirs up the sea,
and filled the air with the smoke and sparks he breathed out of his
mouth. Haymon saw that with all his strength and science he could not
overcome so terrible an enemy; nevertheless, he did not lose heart, but
commended himself to God. Meantime, the streaks of morn began to appear
over the sky, and at sight of them the dragon turned and fled. Haymon
perceived his advantage, and pursued him; by-and-by the rocks bounding
the path contracted, and at last they came to the narrow opening of a
cave. As soon as the dragon had got his head in and could not turn,
Haymon raised his sword with a powerful swing, and calling on God to
aid his stroke, with one blow severed the monster&rsquo;s head from the
trunk. As a trophy of his feat, he cut out the creature&rsquo;s sting,
which was full two feet long, and subsequently hung it up in the
Sanctuary, and something to represent it is still shown in the church
of Wilten. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p>After this, the building went on apace; and when it was completed,
he took up a huge stone which had been left over from the foundation of
the building, and flung it with the whole power of his arm. It sped
over the plain for the space of nearly two miles, till it struck
against the hill of Ambras, and rolled thence down again upon the
plain, &lsquo;where it may yet be seen;&rsquo; and with all the land
between he endowed the monastery. Then he called thither a colony of
Benedictines to inhabit it, and himself lived a life of penance as the
lowest among them for eighteen years; and here he died in the year 878.
Another benefit which he conferred on the neighbourhood was rebuilding
the bridge of Innsbruck.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4290src" href=

the last, in the year 1644, undermined great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>part
of the wall of the church, and caused its fall. The popular belief in
the existence of the giants Haymon and Thyrsis has found a forcible
expression nevertheless in two huge wooden figures, placed at the
entrance of the Minster Church.</p>
<p>The parish church of Wilten has a more ancient and curious relic in
the <i lang="de">Mutter Gottes unter den vier S&auml;ulen</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4331src" href="#xd21e4331" name="xd21e4331src">3</a>
of which it is said, that the Thundering Legion having been stationed
at Valdidena about the year 137, had this image with them; that on one
occasion of being ordered on a distant expedition they buried it under
four trees, and never had the opportunity of recovering it. That when
Rathold von Aiblingen made his pilgrimage to Rome, he brought back with
him the secret of its place of concealment, exhumed it, set it up on
the altar under a baldachino with four pillars, where it has never
ceased to be an object of special veneration. This received a notable
encouragement when Friedrich <i lang="de">mit der leeren Tasche</i>,
wandering in secret through the country with his trusty Hans von
M&uuml;llinen after the ban of the empire had been pronounced against
him, knelt before this shrine, and prayed a blessing on his unchanging
devotion to it. The sequel made him believe that his prayer was heard;
and when he was once more established in his possessions, he caused
himself and his friend to be portrayed kneeling at the shrine to seek
protection <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>under the fostering mantle of the Virgin, and
had the picture hung on the wall of the church opposite.</p>
<p>The name of Innsbruck first occurs in a record of the year 1027, on
occasion of a concession granted to the chapel of <i lang="de">S. Jakob
in der Au</i>&mdash;S. James&rsquo;s in the Field&mdash;probably the
spot on which the stately Pfarrkirche now stands. Prior to this, the
little settlement of inhabitants, whom the commerce between Germany and
Italy had gathered round the Inn-bridge, could only satisfy the
obligation of the Sunday and Holy-day mass by attendance in the church
of Wilten; now, the faculty was granted to their own little chapel.</p>
<p>Its situation made it a convenient entrep&ocirc;t for many articles
of heavy merchandise, and, as years went by, a dwelling-place of
various merchants also. All this time it was a dependency of the monks
of Wilten. In 1180, Berthold II. von Andechs, acquired from them by
treaty certain rights over the prospering town. His successor, Otho I.,
surrounded it with walls and fortifications, and built himself a
residence, on the entrance of which was chiselled the date of 1234, and
the inscription,&mdash;</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Dies Haus stehet in Gottes Hand</p>
<p class="line">Ottoburg ist es genannt.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And on the same spot, in an old house overlooking the
river Inn, some remains of this foundation may be traced, to which the
name of Ottoburg still attaches.</p>
<p>In 1239 it was treated to the privilege of being <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>the
only d&eacute;p&ocirc;t for goods between the Ziller and the Melach;
other concessions followed, maintaining its ever-rising importance. In
1279 Bruno, Bishop of Brixen, consecrated a second church, the
Morizkapelle, in the Ottoburg. But though both its temporal and
spiritual lords appear to have encouraged its growth by every means in
their power, and though there are records of occasional noble
gatherings within its precincts, it was not till after the cession of
Tirol to Austria by Margaretha Maultasch that the convenience of its
central situation, and its water communication by the Inn and Danube
with other towns of the empire, suggested its adoption as the seat of
government of the country.</p>
<p>The fidelity of the towns-people to Duke Rudolf IV. of Austria at
the time of a Bavarian invasion, elicited a further outpouring of
privileges from their ruler, putting beyond all dispute in a short time
the priority of Innsbruck over all the towns of Tirol.</p>
<p>Friederich <i lang="de">mit der leeren Tasche</i> made it his
residence, and his base of operations for reducing the Rottenburgers
and other powerful nobles, who during the late unsettled condition of
the government had set at naught his power and oppressed the people. In
this he received the warmest support of the Innsbruckers, which he in
turn repaid by granting all their wishes.</p>
<p>The singular loyalty of the Tirolese, and their good fortune in
having been generally blessed with upright and noble-minded rulers,
make their annals read like a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238"
href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>continuous heroic romance.
The deeds of their princes have for centuries been household words in
every mountain home of Tirol. None have had a deeper place in their
hearts than the fortunes of <i lang="de">Friedl</i>, and never was any
man more fortunate in his misfortunes. Before they yet knew what manner
of prince he was, the ban of the empire had made him a penniless
wanderer. Reduced to a condition lower than their own, the peasants
wherever he passed gathered round him, and swore to stand by him, and
concealed his hiding-places with the closest fidelity. One night he
came weary and wayworn to Bludenz in Vorarlberg, seeking shelter before
the impending storm. The night-watch had the closest orders to beware
of strangers, for an incursion of the imperial army was expected, and
every stranger might be a spy; no entreaty of Friedl on his friend Hans
could shake his obedience to orders. When the Prince declared who he
was, the man said, &lsquo;Would it were Friedl indeed!&rsquo; but added
that he would not be taken in by the pretence, however well devised. At
last the outcast obtained from him that he would send for an innkeeper
to whom he was known. Mine host at once recognised his sovereign, and
received him with joy. The <i lang="de"><span class="corr" id=
"xd21e4373" title="Source: Thorwachter">Thorw&auml;chter</span></i>
trembled when he found what he had done, but Frederick commended his
steadfastness heartily, and invited him to dine at his table next day.
While he was here, the Emperor summoned the burghers to give up his
prisoner; but the Bludenzers sent answer that &lsquo;they had sworn
fealty to Duke Frederick <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href=
"#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>and the House of Austria, and they
would not break their oath.&rsquo; This spirited reply would probably
have brought an army to their gates had Frederick remained among them;
but in order to save them from an attack, for which they were little
prepared, he took his departure,&mdash;by stealth, or they would not
have suffered him to depart, even for their own safety&rsquo;s sake. At
other times he would earn his day&rsquo;s food by manual labour before
he disclosed to his entertainers who he was, and then he would only
partake of the same frugal fare, and the same hard lodging, as the
peasants who received him. By these means he became deeply endeared to
the people, who thus knew he was one who felt for their privations, and
shared their feelings and opinions, and did not treat them with
supercilious contempt like one of the nobles.</p>
<p>When by these wanderings Frederick had discovered how deeply the
people loved him, he arranged with the owner of the Rofnerhof in the
Oetztal a plan by which, on occasion of a great fair at Landeck, always
crowded by people from all the country round, he appeared in the
character of principal actor in a peasant-comedy, which set forth the
sufferings of a prince driven from his throne by cruel enemies,
wandering homeless among his people, then calling them to arms, and
leading them to victory. The excitement of the people at the
representation exceeded his highest expectations. Loud sobs and cries
accompanied his description of the Prince&rsquo;s woes; but when he
came to sing of the people <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href=
"#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>following their prince&rsquo;s
call to arms, their ardour became quite irresistible. The enthusiasm
was contagious; Frederick could no longer contain himself; he threw off
his disguise, and declared himself their Friedl. It needed no more;
unbidden they proffered their allegiance and their vows to defend his
rights to the last drop of their blood. The enthusiasm of the
Landeckers soon spread over the whole country; and when the Emperor
Sigismund and Ernst der Eiserne and Frederick&rsquo;s other foes found
his people were as firm as their own mountains in his defence, they
gave up the attempt at further persecution, and concluded a truce with
him.</p>
<p>In his prosperity he did not forget the peasants who had stood by
him so loyally. While he tamed the power of their oppressors, he did
all he could to lighten their burdens; and to many, who had rendered
him special service, he marked his gratitude by special favours. Thus,
to Ruzo of the Rofnerhof he granted among other privileges the right of
asylum on his demesne, which was put in use down to the year 1783. We
have already seen his conflict with Henry of Rottenburg,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4384src" href="#xd21e4384" name="xd21e4384src">4</a>
and in the same way he tamed the overgrown power of other nobles. In
the course of our wanderings we shall often find the popular
hero&rsquo;s name stored up in the people&rsquo;s lore.</p>
<p>In connection with Innsbruck, he is well known to the most
superficial tourist as the builder of the <i lang="de">Goldene
Dachl-geb&auml;ude</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href=
"#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span></p>
<p>And what is the <i lang="de">goldene
Dachl-Geb&auml;ude</i>?&mdash;It is a most picturesque addition to, and
almost all remaining of, what in his time was the <i lang=
"de">F&uuml;rstenburg</i>, or princely palace, having a roof of shining
gilt copper tiles, sufficiently low to be in sight of the passer-by;
but the account the best English guide-book gives the tourist of its
origin is so wanting in the true appreciation of Friedl&rsquo;s
character, that I am fain to supply the Tirolese version of it. The
above account says that it was built in 1425 &lsquo;by Frederick,
called in ridicule &ldquo;Empty Purse,&rdquo; who, in order to show how
ill-founded was the nickname, spent thirty thousand ducats on this
piece of extravagance, which probably rendered the nickname more
appropriate than before.&rsquo; Now, to say that he <i>was called</i>
&lsquo;Empty Purse&rsquo; thus vaguely would imply that it was a name
given by common consent, and generally adopted. To say that he built
the Golden Roof only to show that such a nickname was ill-founded, is
simply to accuse him of arrogance. To treat it as an extravagance which
justified the accusation, is to convict him of folly.</p>
<p>But the government of Frederick<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4406src"
href="#xd21e4406" name="xd21e4406src">5</a>&mdash;which is felt even
yet in the present independent spirit of Tirol, which consolidated the
country and made it respected, which set up the dignity of the <i lang=
"de">Freihof</i> and the <i lang="de">Schildhof</i> the foundation of a
middle class as a dam against the encroachments of the nobility on the
peasantry, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>which yet lives on in the hearts of the people,
was an eminently prudent administration, and the story does not fit it.
If, instead of resting satisfied with this compendious but flippant
account, you ask the first true Tirolese you meet to expound it, he
will tell you that Friedl had grown so familiar with peasant life that
he despoiled himself to better the condition of his poorer subjects,
not only by direct means, but by his expeditions in their defence, and
also in forbearing to exact burdensome taxes. The nickname was not
given him by general consent; nor at all, by the people; it was the
cowardly revenge of those selfish nobles who could not appreciate the
abnegation of his character. Frederick saw in it a reproach, offered
not so much to himself as to his people; it seemed to say that the
people who loved him so well withheld the subsidies which should make
him as grand as other monarchs. To disprove the calumny, and to show
that his people enabled him to command riches too, he made this elegant
little piece of display, which served also to adorn his good town of
Innsbruck; but he did not on that account alter his frugal management
of his finances; so that when he came to die, though he had made none
cry out that he had laid burdens on them, he yet left a replenished
treasury.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4417src" href="#xd21e4417" name=
"xd21e4417src">6</a></p>
<p>This is still one of the notable ornaments of Innsbruck. The house
is let to private families, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243"
href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>the &lsquo;gold-roofed&rsquo;
<i lang="de">Erker</i>, or oriel, is kept up as a beloved relic almost
in its original condition. There is a curious old fresco within, the
subject of which is disputed; and on the second floor there is a
sculptured bas-relief, representing Maximilian and his two wives, Mary
of Burgundy and Maria Bianca of Milan, and the seven coats of arms of
the seven provinces under Maximilian&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>Sigismund &lsquo;the Monied,&rsquo; Frederick&rsquo;s son and
successor (1430&ndash;93), is more chargeable with
extravagance,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4436src" href="#xd21e4436"
name="xd21e4436src">7</a> but his extravagance was all for the
advantage of Innsbruck. The reception he gave to Christian I., King of
Denmark, when on his way to Rome, is a striking illustration of the
resources of the country in his time. Sigismund went out to meet him at
some miles&rsquo; distance from the capital, with a train of three
hundred horses, all richly caparisoned; his consort (Eleanor of
Scotland) followed with her suite in two gilt carriages, and surrounded
by fifty ladies and maidens on their palfreys. The King of Denmark
stayed three days; every day was a festival, and the magnificent
dresses of the court were worthy of being specially chronicled. There
seems to have been no lack of satin and velvet and ermine, embroidery,
and fringes of gold-work.</p>
<p>Nor was mental culture neglected; for we find mention, at the same
date, of public schools governed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244"
href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>by &lsquo;a rector,&rsquo;
which would seem to imply that they had something beyond an elementary
character. The impulse given to commerce by the working of the
silver-mines also had the effect of causing some of the chief roads of
the country to be made and improved. The most lasting traces of
Sigismund&rsquo;s reign, however, are the ruined towers which adorn the
mountain landscapes. Wherever we go in Tirol, we come upon some memory
of his expensive fancy for building isolated castles as a <i lang=
"fr">pied &agrave; terre</i> for his hunting and fishing excursions,
still distinguished by such names as Sigmundskron, Sigmundsfried,
Sigmundslust, Sigmundsburg, Sigmundsegg, and which we shall have
occasion to notice as we go along. His wars were of no great benefit to
the country, but his command of money enabled him to include
<span class="corr" id="xd21e4446" title=
"Source: Voralberg">Vorarlberg</span> within his frontier. Sigismund
was, however, entirely wanting in administrative qualities. This
deficiency helped out his extravagance in dissipating the whole benefit
which might have resulted to the public exchequer from the silver-works
of his reign; and at last he yielded to the wholesome counsel of
abdicating in favour of his cousin Maximilian.</p>
<p>Maximilian (1493&ndash;1519) is another of the household heroes of
Tirol. Even after he was raised to the throne of empire he still loved
his Tirolean home, and his residence there further increased the
importance of the town of Innsbruck. He built the new palace in the
Rennplatz, called the Burg, which was completed for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>his
marriage with Maria Bianca, daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, of
Milan. Splendid was the assemblage gathered in <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e4453" title="Source: Innspruck">Innsbruck</span> for this
ceremonial. Three years later it was further astonished by the
magnificence of the Turkish Embassy; and the discussion of various
treaties of peace were also frequently the means of adding brilliancy
to the court, and prosperity to the town. His other benefits to the
city, and Innsbruck&rsquo;s unworthy return to him, I have already
mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.</p>
<p>Many a fantastic <i>Sage</i> is told of Maximilian in the
neighbourhood, which we shall find in their due places. The fine
hunting-ground Tirol affords was one of its greatest attractions for
him; it led him, however, to introduce certain game-laws, and this was
one principal element in bringing about the decline of his popularity
in the last years of his life. At his death this disaffection broke
out, and caused one of the most serious insurrectionary movements which
have disturbed the even tenour of Tirolese loyalty. To this was added
the influence of Lutheran teaching, the effects of which we have seen
in the Zillerthal.</p>
<p>This spirit of discontent had time to gain ground during the first
years of Maximilian&rsquo;s grandson and successor, Charles Quint,
whose immensely extended duties drew his attention off from Tirol. Very
shortly after his accession, however, he made over the German
hereditary dominions, including Tirol, to his brother Ferdinand, who
established his family in this country. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>His wise
administration and prudent concessions soon conciliated the people;
though severe measures were also needed, and the year 1529 was
signalized in Innsbruck by some terrible executions. These were
forgotten when, in the year 1531, Charles Quint, returning victorious
from Pavia, on his way to Augsburg stayed and held court at Innsbruck;
Ferdinand met him on the Brenner pass, and accompanied him to the
capital. When Charles reached the Burg, Ferdinand&rsquo;s children
received him at the entrance; and the tenderness with which he greeted
and kissed them was remarked by the people, on whom this token of
homely affection had a powerful effect. Electors and princes, spiritual
and temporal, came to pay their homage to the Emperor; and Innsbruck
was so filled with the titled throng, that the Landtag had to remove
its session to Hall. Ferdinand&rsquo;s other dominions, and the
question of the threatened war with Turkey, necessitated frequent
absences from Innsbruck. During one of these (in 1534) the Burg was
burnt down, and his children were only rescued from their beds with
difficulty. The great Hall, called the <i lang="de">goldene Saal</i>,
and the state bedroom, which was so beautifully ornamented that it bore
the title of <i lang="de">das Paradies</i>, were all reduced to ashes.
In 1541 Innsbruck was once more honoured by a visit of the magnificent
Emperor; and again, ten years later, he took up his residence there,
that he might be near the Session of the Council of Trent. It was while
he was living here peacefully in all confidence, and almost
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>unattended, that Maurice, Elector of Saxony,
having suddenly joined the Smalkald League, treacherously attempted to
surprise him, marching with a considerable armed force through pass
Fernstein. Charles, who was laid up with illness at the time, was
enabled by the loyal devotion of the Tirolese to escape in the
night-time and in a storm of wind and rain, being borne in a litter
over the Brenner, and by difficult mountain paths through Bruneck into
Carinthia. Maurice, baffled in his scheme, exercised his vengeance in
plundering the imperial possessions, while his followers devastated the
peasants&rsquo; homes, the monastery of Stams, and other religious
houses that lay in their way. The sufferings of the Tirolese on this
occasion doubtless tended to confirm them in their aversion for the
Lutheran League. Maurice&rsquo;s end was characteristic, and the
Tirolese, ever on the look-out for the supernatural, were not slow to
see in it a worthy retribution for his treatment of their Emperor.
Albert of Brandenburg refused to join in the famous Treaty of Passau,
subsequently concluded by Maurice and the other Lutheran leaders with
the Emperor. This and other differences led to a sanguinary struggle
between them, in the course of which Maurice was killed in battle at
Sieverhausen.</p>
<p>Ferdinand the First&rsquo;s reign has many mementos in Innsbruck. He
built the Franciscan church, otherwise called the <i lang="de">heiligen
Kreuzkirche</i> and the <i lang="de">Hofkirche</i>, which, tradition
says, had been projected by his grandfather, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>Kaiser Max, though there is no written record of
the fact; and he raised within it a most grandiose and singular
monument to him, which has alone sufficed to attract many travellers to
Tirol. The original object of the foundation of the church seems to
have been the establishment of a college of canons in this centre, to
oppose the advance of Lutheran teaching. It was begun in 1543, the
first design having been rejected by Ferdinand as not grand enough, and
consecrated in 1563. He seems to have been at some pains to find a
colony of religious willing to undertake, and competent to fulfil, his
requirements; and not coming to an agreement with any in Germany or the
Netherlands, ultimately called in a settlement of Franciscans from
Trent and the Venetian provinces, consisting of twenty priests and
thirteen lay-brothers. The chief ornaments of the building itself are
the ten large&mdash;but too slender&mdash;red marble columns, which
support the <i>plateresque</i> roof. The greater part of the nave is
taken up with Maximilian&rsquo;s monument&mdash;cenotaph rather, for he
lies buried at Wiener-Neustadt, the oft-contemplated translation of his
remains never having been carried into effect. It was Innsbruck&rsquo;s
fault, as we have seen, that they were not originally laid to rest
there, and it is her retribution to have been denied the honour of
housing them hitherto. The monument itself is a pile upwards of
thirteen feet long and six high, of various coloured marbles, raised on
three red marble steps; on the top is a colossal figure, representing
the Kaiser dressed in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=
"#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>full imperial costume, kneeling,
his face being directed towards the altar&mdash;a very fine work, cast
in bronze by Luigi del Duca, a Sicilian, in 1582. The sides and ends
are divided by slender columns into twenty-four fine white marble
compartments,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4489src" href="#xd21e4489"
name="xd21e4489src">8</a> setting forth the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>story of his achievements in lace-like relief.
If the treatment of the facts is sometimes somewhat legendary,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>the details and accessories are most
painstakingly and delicately rendered, great attention having been paid
to the faithfulness of the costumes and buildings introduced, and the
most exquisite finish lavished on all. They were begun in 1561 by the
brothers Bernhard and Arnold Abel, of Cologne, who went in person to
Genoa to select the Carrara tablets for their work; but they both died
in 1563, having only completed three. Then Alexander Collin of Mechlin
took up the work, and with the aid of a large school of artists
completed them in all their perfection in three years more. Around it
stands a noble guard of ancestors historical and mythological, cast in
bronze, of colossal proportions, twenty-eight in number. It is a solemn
sight as you enter in the dusk of evening, to see these stern old
heroes keeping eternal watch round the tomb of him who has been called
&lsquo;the last of the Knights,&rsquo; <i lang="de">der letzte
Ritter</i>. They have not, perhaps, the surpassing merit of the Carrara
reliefs, but they are nobly conceived nevertheless. For lightness of
poise, combined with excellence of proportion and delicacy of finish,
the figure of our own King Arthur commends itself most to my
admiration; but that of Theodoric is generally reckoned to bear away
the palm from all the rest. They stand in the following order.</p>

<p>There is a vast difference in the quality both of the design and
execution of these statues; the greater number and the more artistic
were cast by Gregor L&ouml;ffler, who established a foundry on purpose
at B&uuml;chsenhausen; the rest by Stephen and Melchior Godl, and Hanns
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>Lendenstreich, who worked at M&uuml;hlau, a
suburb of Innsbruck. All honour is due to them for the production of
some of the most remarkable works of their age; but it was some unknown
mind, probably that of some humble nameless Franciscan, to whom is due
the conception and arrangement of this piece of symbolism. It
originally included, besides the statues already enumerated,
twenty-three others, of saints, which were to have received a more
elevated station, and it is for this reason that they are much smaller
in size. They are now placed in the so-called &lsquo;Silver
Chapel,&rsquo; and are too frequently overlooked; but it is necessary
to take them into account in order worthily to criticize this great
monument. They are as follows:&mdash;1. St. Adelgunda, daughter of
Walbert, Count of Haynault. 2. St. Adelbert, Count of Brabant. 3. St.
Doda, wife of St. Arnulf, Duke of the Moselle. 4. St. Hermelinda,
daughter of Witger, Count of Brabant. 5. St. Guy, Duke of Lotharingia.
6. St. Simpert, Bishop of Augsburg, son of Charlemagne&rsquo;s sister
Symporiana, who rebuilt the monastery of St. Magnus at F&uuml;ssen. 7.
St. Jodok, son of a king of Great Britain; he wears a palmer&rsquo;s
dress. 8. St. Landerich, Bishop of Metz, son of St. Vincent, Count of
Haynault, and St. Waltruda. 9. St. Clovis. 10. St. Oda, wife of Duke
Conrad. 11. St. Pharaild, daughter of Witger, Count of Brabant. 12. St.
Reinbert, brother of the last. 13. St. Roland, brother of St. Simpert.
14. St. Stephen, King of Hungary. 15. St. Venantius, martyr, son of
Theodoric, Duke of Lotharingia. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255"
href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>16. St. Waltruda, mother of
St. Landerich (No. 8). 17. St. Arnulf, husband of St. Doda (No. 3),
afterwards Bishop of Metz. 18. St. Chlodulf, son of St. Waltruda (No.
16), also Bishop of Metz. 19. St. Gudula, sister of St. Albert, Count
of Brabant. 20. St. Pepin Teuto, Duke of Brabant. 21. St. Trudo,
priest, son of St. Adela. 22. St. Vincent, monk. 23. Richard
C&oelig;ur-de-Lion. A series of men and women, all more or less closely
connected with the House of Hapsburg, selected for the alleged holiness
of their lives or deeds under one aspect or another. It needs no
laboured argument to show the appropriateness of thus representing to
the life the solidarity of piety and worth in the great hero&rsquo;s
earthly family, though a few words may not be out of place to
distinguish the characters allied only or chiefly by the ties of the
great family of chivalry. These are&mdash;1. King Arthur (No. 8),
representative of the mythology of the Round Table. 2. Roland (No. 13
in the series of the saints), representing the myths of the Twelve
Peers of France. 3. Theodobert (No. 7), who received a hero&rsquo;s
death in the plain of Chalons at the hand of Attila, to be immortalized
in the Western <span class="corr" id="xd21e4599" title=
"Source: Niebelungen">Nibelungen</span> Myths. 4. Theodoric (No. 5),
celebrated as &lsquo;Dietrich von Bern&rsquo; in the Eastern. 5.
Godfrey de Bouillon (No. 22), representing the legendary glory of the
Crusades.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4602src" href="#xd21e4602" name=

<p>The two other statues, of a later date&mdash;St. Francis and St.
Clare&mdash;are by Moll, a native of Innsbruck, who became a sculptor
of some note at Vienna. The picture of St. Anthony over the altar of
the Confraternity of St. Anthony, on the Epistle side of this church,
has a great reputation among the people, because it remained uninjured
in a fire which in 1661 burnt down the church of Zirl, where it was
originally placed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4608src" href=
"#xd21e4608" name="xd21e4608src">11</a> Five years later it was brought
hither for greater honour, and was let into a larger painting by Jele
of Vienna, representing a multitude of sick and suffering brought by
their friends to pray for healing before it. There is not much else in
this church that is noteworthy (besides &lsquo;the Silver
Chapel,&rsquo; which belongs to the notice of Ferdinand II.). What
there is may be mentioned in a few lines, namely&mdash;the <i lang=
"de">F&uuml;rstenchor</i>, or tribune for the royal family, high up on
the right side of the chancel, with the adjoining little chapel and its
paintings, and cedar-wood organ, the gift of Julius II. to Ferdinand
I.; the quaint old clock; and the memory that Queen Christina of Sweden
made her abjuration here 28th October 1655. Her conduct on the occasion
was, according to local tradition, most edifying. She was dressed
plainly in black silk, <a id="xd21e4614" name="xd21e4614"></a>with no
other ornament than a large cross on her breast, with five sparkling
diamonds to recall the glorious Wounds <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb257" href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>of the Redeemer. The
emphasis with which she repeated the Latin profession of faith after
the Papal nuncio did not pass unnoticed. The Ambrosian Hymn was sung at
the close of the ceremony, and the church bells and town cannon spoke
the congratulations of the Innsbruckers on this and the subsequent days
of her stay among them. Among other tokens of gladness, several mystery
plays (which are still greatly in vogue in Tirol) were represented.
Another public ceremony of her stay was the translation of
Kranach&rsquo;s Madonna, the favourite picture of Tirol, brought to it
by Leopold V. The original altar-piece of the Hofkirche, by Paul
Troger&mdash;the Invention of the Cross&mdash;was removed by Maria
Theresa to Vienna, because the figure of the Empress Helena was counted
a striking likeness of herself.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Jesuits into Tirol, and the subsequent
building of the Jesuitenkirche in Innsbruck, and the labours of B.
Peter Canisius among the people, was also the work of Ferdinand I. The
peaceful prosperity which his wise government procured for the country,
while wars and religious divisions were distracting the rest of Europe,
gave opportunity for the development of its literature and
art-culture.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4620src" href="#xd21e4620"
name="xd21e4620src">12</a></p>
<p>One melancholy event of his reign was the outbreak in its last year,
of a terrible epidemic, which committed appalling ravages. All who
could, including <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258"
name="pb258">258</a>]</span>the royal family, escaped to a distance;
and those who had been stricken with it were removed to the <i lang=
"de">Siechenhaus</i>, and isolated from the rest of the population. As
has frequently happened on similar occasions, the dread of the malady
operated to deprive the sick of the help of which they stood in need.
It was when the plague raged highest, and the majority were most
absorbed with the thought of securing their own safety, that a poor
woman of the people, named Magaretha Hueber, rising superior to the
vulgar terror, took upon herself cheerfully the management of the
desolate <i lang="de">Siechenhaus</i>. The example of her courage was
all that was needed to bring out the Christian confidence and charity
of the masses; and to her devotion was owing not only the relief of the
plague-stricken, but the moral effect of her spirit and energy was also
not without its fruit in staying the havoc of the contagion; and she is
still remembered by the name of <i lang="de">die fromme
Siechen</i>.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death (which happened in 1564), Ferdinand had his
second son, Ferdinand II., publicly acknowledged in the Landtag of
Innsbruck, <i lang="de">Landesf&uuml;rst</i> of Tirol. His own
affection for the country had prevented him from suffering its
interests to be ever neglected by the pressure of his vast rule; and
now when his great age warned him that he would be able to watch over
it no longer, he determined to give it once more the benefit of an
independent government.</p>
<p>Ferdinand II. seems to have had all the excellent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>administrative qualities of his father in the
degree necessary for his restricted sphere of dominion. His disposition
for the culture of peaceful arts was promoted by the happiness of his
family life. The story of his early love, and his marriage in
accordance with the dictates of his heart, in an age when matrimonial
alliances were too often dictated by political considerations alone,
have made one of the romances dearest to the popular mind. The natural
retribution of a disturbance of the regular succession to the throne
followed, but with Tirol&rsquo;s usual good fortune the consequences
did not prove disastrous, as we shall see later on.</p>
<p>Situated at the distance of a pleasant hour&rsquo;s walk from
Innsbruck, and forming an exceedingly picturesque object in the views
from it, is Schloss Ambras, in ancient times one of the chief bulwarks
of the Innthal. Ferdinand I. bought it of the noble family of Schurfen
at the time when he nominated his son to the government of the country,
and it always remained Ferdinand II.&rsquo;s favourite residence.
Hither he brought home the beautiful Philippine Welser, whose grace and
modesty had won his heart at first sight, as she leant forward from her
turret window to cast her flowery greeting at the feet of the Emperor
Charles Quint when he came into Augsburg, and the young and handsome
prince rode by his side. Philippine had been betrothed by her father to
the heir of the Fugger family, the richest and most powerful of
Augsburg; but her eyes had met Ferdinand&rsquo;s, and that one glance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>had revealed to both that their happiness lay in
union with each other. Fortunately for Philippine she possessed in her
mother a devoted confidant and ally. True, Ferdinand could not rest
till he had obtained a stolen interview with her; but the true German
woman had confidence in the honour and virtue of the reigning House,
and the words Philippine, who was truth itself, reported were those of
true love, which knows no shame. Nevertheless, the Fugger was urgent,
and old Welser&mdash;a sturdy upholder of his family tradition for
upright dealing&mdash;never, they knew, could be brought to be wanting
to his word. The warm love of youth, however, is ever a match for the
steady calculation of age. While the fathers Welser and Fugger were
counting their money-bags, Ferdinand had devised a plan which easily
received the assent of Philippine&rsquo;s affection for him, the rather
that her mother, for whom a daughter&rsquo;s happiness stood dearer
than any other consideration, gave it her countenance and aid. At an
hour agreed, Ferdinand appeared beneath the turret where their
happiness was first revealed to them; at a little distance his horses
were in waiting. Not an instant had he to wait; Philippine, already
fortified by her mother&rsquo;s farewell benediction, joined him ere a
pang of misgiving had time to enter his mind, an old and trusted family
servant accompanying her. Safely the fugitives reached the chapel,
where a friendly priest&mdash;Ferdinand&rsquo;s confessor, Johann
Cavaller&uuml;s&mdash;waited to bless the nuptials of the devoted pair,
the old servant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261"
name="pb261">261</a>]</span>acting as witness. Old Franz Welser was
subsequently induced to give his approval and paternal benediction; and
if his burgher pride was wounded by his daughter marrying into a family
which might look down upon her connexions, he had the consoling
reflection that he was able to give her a dowry which many princes
might envy; and also in the discovery of a friendly antiquary, that
even his lineage, if not royal, was not either to be despised, for it
could be traced up to the same stock which gave Belisarius to the
Empire!</p>
<p>Ferdinand&rsquo;s marriage was, I believe, never known to his
father; though there are stories of his being won over to forgive it by
Philippine&rsquo;s gentle beauty and worth, but these are probably
referable to the succeeding Emperor. However this may be, the devoted
pair certainly lived for some time in blissful retirement at Ambras;
and after his brother, Maximilian II., had acknowledged the legality of
Ferdinand&rsquo;s marriage&mdash;on the condition that the offspring of
it should never claim the rank of Archdukes of Austria&mdash;Ambras,
which had been their first retreat, was so endeared to them, that they
always loved to live there better than anywhere else. There were born
to them two sons&mdash;Karl, who afterwards became a Cardinal and
Bishop of Brixen; and Andreas, Markgrave of Burgau, to whom Ferdinand
willed Ambras, on condition that he should maintain its regal beauties,
and preserve undiminished the rich stores of books and rare
manuscripts, coins, armour, objects of vert&ugrave;, and curiosities of
every sort which it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262"
name="pb262">262</a>]</span>had been the delight of his and
Philippine&rsquo;s leisure hours to collect. This testamentary
disposition the son judged would be best carried out by selling the
place to the Emperor Rudolf II. in 1606; and Ambras has accordingly
ever since been reckoned a pleasure-seat of the imperial family. The
unfortunate love of centralization, more than the fear of foreign
invasion, which was the ostensible pretext, deprived Tirol of these
treasures. They were removed to Vienna in 1806, where they may be
visited in the Belvedere Palace, the promise of restoring them, often
made, not having yet been fulfilled. Among the remnants that are left,
are still some tokens of Ferdinand&rsquo;s taste and genius, and some
touching memorials of thirty years of happiness purer and truer than
had often before been combined with the enjoyment of power. There are
some pieces of embroidery, with which Philippine occupied her lonely
hours while Ferdinand&rsquo;s public duties obliged him to be away from
her, among them a well-executed Crucifixion; and some natural
curiosities in the shape of gnarled and twisted roots, needing little
effort of the imagination to convert into naturally&mdash;perhaps
supernaturally&mdash;formed crucifixes, and which they had doubtless
found pleasure in unearthing in the woods round Ambras. At the time of
my visit the private chapel was being very well restored, and some
frescoes very fairly executed by Wienhold, a local artist who has
studied in Rome. There is still a small <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>collection of armour,
and a suit of clothes worn by a giant in the suite of Charles Quint,
which would appear to have belonged to a man near eight feet high; also
some portraits of the Hapsburg family and other rulers of Tirol; among
them Margareta Maultasch, which, if it be faithful, disproves the story
deriving her name from the size of her mouth; but of this I shall have
occasion to speak later. Inglis mentions that among the relics is a
piece of the tree on which Judas hanged himself, but it was not shown
to me.</p>
<p>The people, whose own experience fixes the law of suffering in their
minds, will have it that these years of tranquil joy were not
unalloyed; but that Philippine&rsquo;s mother-in-law embittered them by
her jealous bickerings and reproaches, and that these in the end led
her to make a sacrifice of her life to the exigencies of her
husband&rsquo;s glory. The bath is yet pointed out at Ambras where she
is said to have bled herself to death to make way for a consort more
conformable to her husband&rsquo;s birth. All, even local, historians,
however, are agreed in rejecting this tradition.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4663src" href="#xd21e4663" name="xd21e4663src">13</a> It has
served nevertheless to endear her to the popular mind, for whom she is
still a model of domestic virtues no less than a type of beauty.
Scarcely is there a house in Tirol that is not adorned by her image.
Among other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>traditions of her personal perfections, it is
fabled that her skin was so delicate that the colour of the red wine
could be seen softly opalized as it passed her slender throat.<a class=

convenience of the visitor to Innsbruck, but not to interrupt the text,
I subjoin here a list of the subjects. (1.) The marriage of Maximilian
(then aged eighteen) with Mary of Burgundy at Ghent. (2.) His victory
over the French at Guinegate, when he was twenty. (3.) The taking of
Arras thirteen years later; not only are the fighting folk and the
fortifications in this worthy of special praise, but there is a bit of
by-play, the careful finish of which must not be overlooked; and the
figure of one woman in particular, who is bringing provisions to the
camp, is a masterpiece in itself. (4.) Maximilian is crowned King of
the Romans. The scene is the interior of the Cathedral of
Aix-la-Chapelle: the Prince is seated on a sort of throne before the
altar; the Electors are busied with their hereditary part in the
ceremony; the dresses of the courtiers in the crowd, and the ladies
high above in their tribune, are a perfect record for the costumier, so
minute are they in <span class="corr" id="xd21e4491" title=
"Source: faitfulness">faithfulness</span>. (5.) The battle of Castel
della Pietra, or Stein am Calliano, the landscape background of which
is excellent; the Tirolese are seen driving the Venetians with great
fury before them over the Etsch (Adige). (6.) Maximilian&rsquo;s entry
into Vienna (1490), in course of the contest for the crown of Hungary
after the death of Matthias Corvinus; the figure of Maximilian on his
prancing horse is drawn with great spirit. (7.) The siege of
Stuhlweissenburg, taken by Maximilian the same year; the horses in this
tableau deserve particular notice. (8.) The eighth represents an
episode which it must have required some courage to record among the
acts of so glorious a reign; it shows Maximilian receiving back his
daughter Margaret, when, in 1493, Charles VIII. preferred Anne of
Brittany to her. The French envoys hand to the Emperor two keys,
symbols of the suzerainty of Burgundy and Artois, the price of the
double affront of sending back his daughter and depriving him of his
bride, for Anne had been betrothed to him. [Margaret, though endowed
with the high qualities of her race, was not destined to be fortunate
in her married life: her hand was next sought by Ferdinand V. of Spain
for his son Don Juan, who died very shortly after the marriage. She was
again married, in 1508, to Philibert Duke of Savoy, who died without
children three years later. As Governor of the Netherlands, however,
her prudent administration made her very popular.] (9.)
Maximilian&rsquo;s campaign against the Turks in Croatia. (10.) The
League of Maximilian with Alexander VI., the Doge of Venice, and the
Duke of Milan, against Charles VIII. of France; the four potentates
stand in a palatial hall joining hands, and the French are seen in the
background fleeing in dismay. (11.) The investiture at Worms of
Ludovico Sforza with the Duchy of Milan. The portraits of Maximilian
are well preserved on each occasion that he is introduced, but in none
better than in this one: Maria Bianca is seen seated to the left of the
throne, Sforza kneels before them; on the waving standard, which is the
token of investiture, the ducal arms are plainly discernible. (12.) The
marriage at Brussels, in 1496, of Philip <i lang="de">der
Sch&ouml;ne</i>, Maximilian&rsquo;s son, with Juana of Spain; the
Archbishop of Cambrai is officiating, Maximilian stands on the right
side of his son: Charles Quint was born of this marriage. (13.) A
victorious campaign in Bohemia in 1504. The 14th represents the
episodes of the siege of Kufstein, recorded in the second chapter of
these Traditions (1504). (15.) The submission of Charles d&rsquo;Egmont
to Maximilian, 1505. The Kaiser sits his horse majestically; the Duke
of Gueldres stands with head uncovered; the battered battlements of the
city are seen behind them. (16.) The League of Cambrai, 1508. The scene
is a handsome tent in the camp near Cambray; Maximilian, Julius II.,
Charles VIII., and Ferdinand V., are supposed to meet, to unite in
league against Venice. (17.) The Siege of Padua, 1509, the first result
of this League; the view of Padua in the distance must have required
the artist to have visited the place. (18.) The expulsion of the French
from Milan, and reinstatement of Ludovico Sforza, 1512. (19.) The
second battle of Guinegate: Maximilian fights on horseback; Henry VIII.
leads the allied infantry, 1515. (20.) The conjunction of the Imperial
and English forces before Terouenne: Maximilian and Henry are both on
foot, 1513. (21.) The battle of Vicenza, 1513. (22.) The Siege of
Marano, on <span class="corr" id="xd21e4499" title=
"Source: tho">the</span> Venetian coast. The 23rd represents a noble
hall at Vienna, such details as the pictures on the walls not being
omitted: Maximilian is treating with Uladisaus, King of Hungary, for
the double marriage of their offspring&mdash;Anna and Ludwig, children
of the latter, with Ferdinand and Maria, grandchildren of the
former&mdash;an alliance which had its consequence in the subsequent
incorporation of Hungary with the Empire. (24.) The defence of Verona
by the Imperial forces against the French and Venetians.</p>

where Wallenstein, while a page in the household of Ferdinand and
Philippine, fell unharmed from the window of the corridor leading to
the dining-hall, making in the terrible moment a secret vow to the
Blessed Virgin of his conversion if he escaped with life, which
hastened the work begun doubtless by Philippine&rsquo;s devout example
and teaching. There is another, again, more marvellous still, and dated
from an earlier period, and shortly before the purchase of the castle
by the reigning family. It is said that Theophrastus <span class="corr"
id="xd21e4708" title="Source: Paracelus">Paracelsus</span>, of whom
many weird stories are told, was at one time sojourning at
Innsbruck&mdash;where, another tradition has it, he died&mdash;and in
the course of his wanderings in search of plants of strange healing
powers, came to this outlying and then neglected castle. A peasant
woman seeing him pass her cottage weary and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>footsore, asked him to come in and rest and
taste her freshly-baked cakes, of which the homely odour scented the
air. The man of strange science thanked her for her hospitality, and in
return touched the tongs upon the hearth with his wonder-working book,
and behold the iron was turned into pure gold. The origin of such a
legend as this is easy to trace; the book of the <i>touch</i> of which
such virtue is fabled, plainly represents the learning of the studious
savant, which brought him, as well as fame, pecuniary advantage,
enabling him to astonish the peasants with payment in the precious
metal not often seen by them. But there are many others told of him,
the details of which are more complicated, and wander much further from
the outline of fact. The way in which he became possessed of his
wonder-working power is thus accounted for.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4716src" href="#xd21e4716" name="xd21e4716src">2</a> One Sunday
morning, when he was after his custom wandering in search of plants in
a forest on the heights not far from Innsbruck, he heard a voice
calling him out of a tree. &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; cried Paracelsus.
&lsquo;I am he whom men call the Evil One,&rsquo; answered the voice;
&lsquo;but how wrong they are you shall judge; if you but release me
out of this tree you shall see I am not evil at all.&rsquo; &lsquo;How
am I to set about it?&rsquo; asked the clever Doctor. &lsquo;Only look
straight up the stem of the pine opposite you, and you will see a bung
with three crosses on it; all you have to do is to pull it out, and I
am free; if you do this I will show you how good I am by giving you the
two things you most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267"
name="pb267">267</a>]</span>desire, an elixir which shall turn all to
gold, and another which shall heal every malady.&rsquo; Paracelsus,
lured by the tempting promise, pulled out the bung, and straightway an
ugly black spider crawled out of the hole, and quickly transformed
itself into an old man wrapped in a scarlet mantle. The demon kept his
word, and gave the Doctor the promised phials, but immediately began
threatening the frightful vengeance he would wreak on the exorcist who
had confined him in the tree. Paracelsus now blamed himself for his too
ready confidence in the character the demon had given himself for
goodness, and bethought him of a means of playing on the imp&rsquo;s
vanity. &lsquo;What a knowing man that same exorcist must be,&rsquo;
said Paracelsus, &lsquo;to turn a tall powerful fellow like you into a
spider, and then drive you into a tree.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not a bit of
it,&rsquo; replied the imp, piqued, &lsquo;he couldn&rsquo;t have done
anything of the sort, it was all my own doing.&rsquo; &lsquo;Your own
doing!&rsquo; exclaimed Paracelsus, with a mocking laugh. &lsquo;Is
that likely? I have heard of people being transformed by some one of
greater power than themselves, never by their own.&rsquo; &lsquo;You
shall see, though,&rsquo; said the provoked imp; and with that he
quickly resumed the form of a spider, and crawled back into the
hole.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4725src" href="#xd21e4725" name=
"xd21e4725src">3</a> Paracelsus, it may well be imagined, lost no time
in replacing the bung, on which he cut three fresh <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>crosses to renew the spell; and never can he
again be released, for it was agreed never to cut down this forest on
account of the protection it afforded to the country against the
avalanches.</p>
<p>But, it may be asked, the wonder-working phials once vouchsafed to
men, would surely be taken good care of. There is a legend to provide
for that too.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4735src" href="#xd21e4735"
name="xd21e4735src">4</a> When the other doctors of Innsbruck found
that Paracelsus so far exceeded them in skill, they determined to
poison him. Paracelsus had knowledge of their plot by his arts, he knew
too that there was only one remedy against the poison they had adopted,
and he shut himself up, telling his servant not to disturb him for five
days. At the end of the fourth day, however, the curious servant came
into his room and broke the spell. Paracelsus had employed a
wonder-working spider to draw out the poison, which it would have done
in the course of five days. Disturbed on the fourth, Paracelsus knew he
must die. Determined that the jealous members of his profession should
not profit by their crime, he sent his servant with the two phials and
bid him stand in the middle of the Inn-bridge and throw them into the
river. Where they fell into the river the water was streaked with
molten gold.</p>
<p>It remains to call attention to the splendid and truly Tirolean
panoramic view from the pretty terrace of Ambras, with its luxuriant
trellis of passion-flower <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>and &lsquo;virgin vine.&rsquo;
Overhanging the village of Ambras is the so-called <i lang=
"de">Tummelplatz</i>, where in the lifetime of Ferdinand and
Philippine, many a gay tournament was held, but since used as a
burying-place; first for the military hospital, to which the castle was
at one time devoted&mdash;and some seven or eight thousand patriots
were interred here between 1796 and 1810&mdash;and afterwards for those
who fell successfully resisting the Italian invasion of 1859.</p>
<p>Whatever was the manner of Philippine&rsquo;s death, it was bitterly
lamented by Ferdinand, who found the usual refuge of human grief in
raising a splendid monument to her memory, in the so-called <i lang=
"de">Silberne Kapelle</i> in the Hofkirche. The chapel had been built
by him to satisfy her devotion to the doctrine of the Immaculate
Conception; and in her lifetime was so called from the solid silver
image of the Blessed Virgin, and the bas-reliefs of the mysteries of
the rosary in the same metal over the altar, itself a valuable ebony
carving. She had loved to pray there, and it accordingly formed a
fitting resting-place for her mortal remains. Her effigy in marble over
her altar-shaped tomb is a figure of exceeding beauty, and is ascribed
to Alexander Collin; it stands under a marble canopy. The upright slab
is of white marble, carved in three compartments; the centre one
bearing a modest inscription, and the other two, subjects recording her
charity to the living and the dead; the outline of the town of
Innsbruck, as it appeared in her day, forms the background. By
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>his desire Ferdinand was buried near her; his
monument is similarly sunk in the thickness of the wall, which is
adorned with shields carved in relief, bearing the arms of his house
painted with their respective tinctures; and on the tomb are marble
reliefs, setting forth (after the manner of those on Maximilian&rsquo;s
cenotaph) the public acts of his life. This chapel came to be used
afterwards for Italian sermons by the consorts of subsequent rulers of
Tirol, many of whom were Italians.</p>
<p>In 1572 Innsbruck was visited by a severe shock of earthquake, which
overthrew many buildings, and so filled the people with alarm, that
temporary wooden huts were built in the open field where they took
refuge. Ferdinand and Philippine had recourse to the same means of
safety; and while living thus, their only daughter, Anna Eleonora, was
born. In thanksgiving for this favour, and for the cessation of the
panic, the royal pair vowed a pilgrimage to Seefeld,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4757src" href="#xd21e4757" name="xd21e4757src">5</a> which
they accomplished on foot, accompanied by their sons; above two
thousand Innsbruckers following them. The general sentiment of
gratitude was further testified by the enactment on the part of
Ferdinand, and the glad acceptance on the part of the people, of
various rules of devotion, which have gone to form the subsequent
habits of the people. Three years of dearth succeeded the earthquake,
and were accepted by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href=
"#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>pious ruler and people as a
heavenly warning to lead them to increased faith and devotion. Many
Lutheran books which had escaped earlier measures against them were
spontaneously brought forward and burnt; special devotion to the
Blessed Sacrament was promoted, Ferdinand himself setting the example;
for whenever he met the Viaticum on the way to the sick, whether he was
in a carriage or on horseback, he never failed to alight and kneel upon
the ground, whatever might be its condition. This was indeed a special
tradition of his house; it is told of Rudolf of Hapsburg, that one day
as he was out hunting, a furious storm came on, soon swelling the
mountain torrents and sweeping away paths and bridges. On the brink of
a raging stream, which there was no means of crossing, stood a priest,
weather-bound on his way to carry the last sacrament to a dying
parishioner. Rudolf recognised the sound of the bell, and directed his
steps by its leading to pay his homage to the &lsquo;<i lang=
"de">hochw&uuml;rdigste Gut</i>.&rsquo; He no sooner learned the
priest&rsquo;s difficulty than he dismounted, and offered him his own
horse. When the priest brought the animal back next day, the pious
prince told him he could not think of himself again crossing a horse
which had been honoured by having borne his Lord and Redeemer, and
begged him to keep it for the future service of religion.</p>
<p>While Philippine&rsquo;s relations never sought to overstep the
limits which imperial etiquette had set them, Ferdinand seems to have
treated them with kind cordiality. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272"
href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>An instance of this was the
magnificence with which he celebrated the marriage of her nephew,
Johann von Kolourat, with her maid-of-honour, Katarina von Boimont, in
1580: the &lsquo;<i lang="de">Neustadt</i>&rsquo; or principal street
afforded space for tournaments and races which lasted many days, and
attracted the remaining votaries of chivalry from all parts of Europe.
The festivities were closed by a splendid pageant, in which Ferdinand
took part as &lsquo;Olympian Jove.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1582 Ferdinand married Anna Katharina Gonzaga, daughter of the
Duke of Mantua, who was no less pious than Philippine. The marriage was
celebrated at Innsbruck with great pomp. She was the first to introduce
the Capuchin Order into Germany. Some discussion in the general chapter
of the Order preceded the decision which allowed the monks to accept
the consequences of being exposed to a colder climate than that to
which they had been used. The first stone of their monastery was laid
by Ferdinand and Anna Katharina in August 1593, at the intersection of
the Universit&auml;ts-gasse and the Sill-gasse. Ferdinand died the
following year, regretted by all the people, but by none more than by
Anna Katharina, who passed the remainder of her days in a convent she
had founded at Innsbruck. She died in 1621, and desired the following
inscription to be put on her tomb:&mdash;&lsquo;<i lang="la">Miserere
mei Domine dum veneris in novissimo die.</i>&rsquo;</p>
<p>The warning of the disastrous years 1572&ndash;4 was further turned
to practical account by Ferdinand in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>his desire to relieve
the distress of the peasants. In the first months of threatening famine
he bought with his own means large stores of grain in Hungary and
Italy, and opened dep&ocirc;ts in various parts of Tirol, where it was
sold at a reasonable price. To provide a means of earning money for
those who were shut out of their ordinary labour, he laid out or
improved some of the most important high roads; he likewise exerted
himself in every way to promote the commerce of the country. His reign
conferred many other benefits on the people. Many laws were amended and
brought in conformity with the altered circumstances of the age; the
principle of self-taxation was established, and other measures enacted
which it does not belong to my present province to particularise. He
introduced also the use of the Gregorian Calendar, and gave great
encouragement to the cultivation of letters. It was by his care that
the most authentic MSS. of the Nibelungen poems and other examples of
early literature were preserved to us.</p>
<p>As Ferdinand had no children by Anna Katharina, and those of
Philippine were not allowed to succeed,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4784src" href="#xd21e4784" name="xd21e4784src">6</a> the rule
over Tirol went back at his death to the Emperor Rudolf II.,
Maximilian&rsquo;s eldest son. In 1602, however, he gave over the
government to his brother Maximilian, who is distinguished by the name
of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span><i lang="de">Deutschmeister</i>. Tirol was again
fortunate in her ruler; Maximilian was as pious and prudent a prince as
his predecessors. He promoted the educational establishments of the
town, and was a zealous opponent of religious differences; he brought
in the Order of Servites to oppose the remaining germs of Lutheran
teaching; the church and monastery at the end of the Neustadt being
built for them by Katharina Maria. There are some pictures in the
church by Theophilus Polak, Martin Knoller, Grasmair, and other native
artists; and the frescoes on the roof by Sch&ouml;pf are worth
attention. A fanatic named Paul Lederer, one of the very few Tirol has
produced, rose in this reign, and carried away about thirty persons to
join a kind of sect which he attempted to form; in accordance with the
laws of the age, he was tried and executed, after which his followers
were no more heard of.</p>
<p>Maximilian was much attached to the Capuchins, and built himself a
little hermitage within their precincts, which is still shown, where he
spent all the time he could spare in prayer and meditation; following
the rule of the monks, rising with them to their night Offices, and
employing himself at manual labour in the field and in the workshop
like one of them. His cell is paneled with plain wood, the bed and
chair are of the most ordinary make, as are the ink-stand and other
necessary articles, mostly his own handiwork; it has a window high up
in the chancel, whence he could assist <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>at the Offices in the
church. The Empress Maria Theresa visited it in 1765, and seating
herself in the stiff wooden chair, exclaimed, &lsquo;What men our
forefathers were!&rsquo; Another illustrious pilgrim, whose visit is
treasured in the memories of the house, was St. Lorenzo of Brindisi,
when on his way to found a house of the Order in Austria. The monks
begged of him his Hebrew Bible, his walking-stick, and breviary, which
are still treasured as relics. All the churches of Innsbruck and many
throughout Tirol felt the benefit of Maximilian&rsquo;s devotion to the
Church. His spirit was emulated by the townspeople, and when the fatal
epidemic of 1611 ceased its ravages, the burghers of Innsbruck built
the <span lang="de">Dreiheiligkeitskirche</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4797src" href="#xd21e4797" name="xd21e4797src">7</a> for the
Jesuits, as a thank-offering that the plague was stayed.</p>
<p>The temporal affairs of Tirol received no less attention from
Archduke Maximilian than the spiritual. With the foresight of a true
statesman, he discovered the coming troubles of the Thirty Years&rsquo;
War, and resolved that the defences of his country should be in a state
to keep the danger at a distance from her borders. The fortified
towers, especially those commanding the passes into the country, were
all overlooked, and plans of them carefully prepared, all the
fortifications being put in repair. The Landwehr, the living bulwarks,
the ready defenders of their beloved mountain Vaterland, attracted his
still more special attention, and he furnished them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>with
a regulation suited to the needs of the times. He settled also several
outstanding disputes with the Venetians, with Count Arco, and with
neighbours over the north and west frontiers; and an internal boundary
quarrel between the Bishops of Brixen and Trent. The death of Rudolf
II., in 1612, had invested him with supreme authority over the country,
and simplified his action in all these matters for the benefit of the
commonwealth.</p>
<p>Another outburst of pestilence occurred in 1611; the old <i lang=
"de">Siechen-haus</i> was not big enough for all the sick, and had no
church attached to it. Two Jesuits&mdash;the professor of theology at
their university, and Kaspar von K&ouml;stlan, a native of
Brixen&mdash;assisted by a lay-brother, devoted themselves to the
service of the sick; their example so edified the Innsbruckers, that in
their admiration they readily provided the means, at their exhortation,
to build a church. Hanns Zimmermann, Dean of the Burgomasters, bound
himself by a vow to see to the erection of the building, and from that
time it was observed the fury of the pestilence began to diminish.
Maximilian bought the neighbouring house and appointed it for the
residence of the chaplain of the <i lang="de">Siechen-haus</i> and the
doctors. He gave also the altarpiece by St&ouml;tzl, representing the
three <i lang="de">Pestschutzheiligen</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4815src" href="#xd21e4815" name="xd21e4815src">8</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>and
another quaint and curious picture of the plague-genius.</p>
<p>Maximilian died in 1618, and a religious vow having kept him
unmarried, the government was transferred to Leopold V., Archduke of
Styria, again a most exemplary man. His father was Charles II., son of
the Emperor Ferdinand I.; he had <span class="corr" id="xd21e4822"
title="Source: orginally">originally</span> been devoted to the
ecclesiastical state, and nominated Bishop of Strasburg and Passau; but
out of regard for the exigencies of the country a dispensation, of
which I think history affords only two or three other examples, was
granted him from Rome. He married the celebrated Claudia de&rsquo;
Medici, Duchess of Urbino. Though also Governor of the Low Countries,
he by no means neglected the affairs of Tirol. Some fresh attempts of
Lutherans to interfere with its religious unity, as well as to foment
political dissensions, were put down with a resolute hand. Friedrich
von Tiefenbach, sometime notorious as a politico-religious leader in
Moravia, was discovered in a hiding-place he had selected, in the wild
caves at Pf&auml;ffers<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4825src" href=
"#xd21e4825" name="xd21e4825src">9</a> below Chur, and tried and
beheaded at Innsbruck in 1621. The selection of Innsbruck for the
marriage of the Emperor Ferdinand II. with his second wife Eleonora,
daughter of the Duke of Mantua, in 1622, revived the splendours of
Maximilian&rsquo;s reign, for the Emperor stayed there some weeks with
all his court; the <i lang="de">Landwehr</i> turned out three thousand
strong to form his guard of honour. It was the depth of winter,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>but the bride braved the snow; the Count of
Harrach was sent out to meet her on the Brenner Pass with six gilt
sledges, and a vast concourse of people. It is recorded that the
Emperor wore on the occasion an entirely white suit embroidered with
gold and pearls, on his shoulders a short sky-blue cloak lined with
cloth of gold, and a diamond chain round his neck. Eleonora, more in
accordance with the season, wore a tight-fitting dress of carnation
satin embroidered in gold, over it a sable jacket, and a hat with a
plume of eagles&rsquo; feathers. The banquet was entirely served by
young Tirolean nobles. The Emperor&rsquo;s present to his bride was a
pearl <i>parure</i>, costing thirty thousand ducats; and that of the
town of Innsbruck a purse of eighteen thousand ducats. Leopold was
confirmed by his imperial brother in the government on this occasion.
His own marriage was celebrated with scarcely less state than the
Emperor&rsquo;s in April 1626, an array of handsome tents being pitched
in the meadows of Wilten, where the <i lang=
"de">Landessch&uuml;tzen</i> performed many marksmen&rsquo;s feats for
the diversion of the company assembled for the ceremonial. This
included the Archbishop of Salzburg, who officiated in the Church
function, one hundred and fifty counts and barons, and three hundred of
noble blood. The visit of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1628, and of
Ferdinand, King of Hungary and Bohemia, in 1629, were other notable
occasions of rejoicing for Innsbruck.</p>
<p>Leopold benefited and adorned the town by the enclosure and planting
of the <i lang="de">Hofgarten</i>, and the bronze <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>equestrian statue of himself, still one of its
chief ornaments; but his memory has been more deeply endeared to the
people by the present of Kranach&rsquo;s Madonna, which they have
copied in almost every church, household, and highway of the country.
It is a little picture on panel, very like many of its date, in which
the tenderness of devotion beams through and redeems all the stiffness
of mannerism; but which we are apt to pass, I had almost said by the
dozen, in the various galleries of Europe, with no more than a casual
glance. With the Tirolese it was otherwise. Their faith-inspired eyes
saw in it a whole revelation of Divine mercy and love; they gazed on
the outpouring of maternal fondness and filial confidence in the
unutterable communion of the Mother and the Son there portrayed; and
deeming that where so much love reigned no petition could be rejected,
they believed that answers to the frequent prayers of faith sent up
before it were reaped an hundredfold,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4847src" href="#xd21e4847" name="xd21e4847src">10</a> and the
fame of the benefits so derived was symbolized in the title universally
given to the picture, of <i lang=
"de">Mari&auml;h&uuml;lfsbild</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4853src"
href="#xd21e4853" name="xd21e4853src">11</a> Leopold being in the early
part of his reign on a visit to the Elector of Saxony, on occasion of
one of his journeys between Tirol and the Low Countries, and being lost
in admiration of his collection of pictures at Dresden, received from
him the offer of any painting he liked to select. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>There were many choice specimens, but the
devotional conception of this picture carried him away from all the
rest, and it became the object of his selection. He never parted from
it afterwards, and it accompanied him in all his journeyings. When in
Innsbruck, it formed the altar-piece of the <i lang=
"de">Hofkapelle</i>, whither the people crowded to kindle their
devotion at its focus. After the withdrawal of the allied French,
Swedish, and Hessian troops in 1647, the Innsbruckers, in thanksgiving
for the success of their prayers before it, built the elegant little
circular temple<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4865src" href="#xd21e4865"
name="xd21e4865src">12</a> on the left bank of the Inn, still called
the Mari&auml;h&uuml;lfskirche, thinking to enshrine it there; but
Ferdinand Karl, who had then succeeded to his father Leopold, could not
bear to part with it, and gave them a copy instead, by Paul Schor,
inserted in a larger picture representing it borne by angels, and the
notabilities of Innsbruck kneeling beneath it, the
Mari&auml;h&uuml;lfskirche being introduced into the background
landscape. However, the number of people who pressed to approach it was
so great that he was in a manner constrained to bestow it on the
Pfarrkirche only two or three years later, where it now remains; it was
translated thither during Queen Christina&rsquo;s visit, as I have
mentioned above. It was borne on a car by six white horses, the crowded
streets being strewn with flowers. It is a small picture, and has been
let into a large canvas painted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281"
href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>in Sch&ouml;pf&rsquo;s best
manner, with angels which appear to support it, and beneath St. James,
patron of the church, and St. Alexius. A centenary festival was
observed in memory of the translation by Maria Theresa in 1750, when
all the precious <i lang="la">ex votos</i>, the thank-offerings for
many granted prayers, were exposed to view under the light streaming
from a hundred silver candelabra, the air around being perfumed by the
flowers of a hundred silver vases. The procession was a splendid
pageant, in which no expense seems to have been spared, the great
Empress herself, accompanied by her son, afterwards Joseph II., heading
it. This was repeated&mdash;in a manner corresponding with the
diminished magnificence of the age&mdash;in 1850, the Emperor Ferdinand
I., the Empress Anna, and other members of the Imperial family, taking
their part in it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4873src" href="#xd21e4873"
name="xd21e4873src">13</a></p>
<p>The only remaining act of Leopold&rsquo;s reign which calls for
mention in connexion with Innsbruck, was the erection of the monument
to Maximilian the Deutschmeister, in the Pfarrkirche, almost the only
one that was spared when the church was rebuilt after the earthquakes
of 1667 and 1689, the others having been <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>ruthlessly
used&mdash;the headstones in building up the walls, the bronze ones in
the bell-castings.</p>
<p>Leopold&rsquo;s son, Ferdinand Karl, being under age at the time of
his death, in 1632, he was succeeded by his widow, Claudia de&rsquo;
Medici, as regent. The troubles of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, in
which Leopold like other German princes had had his chequered share,
were yet raging. Claudia was equal to the exigencies of her time and
country. She continued the measures of Maximilian the <i lang=
"de">Deutschmeister</i> for perfecting the defences of the country, and
particularly all its inlets; and she encouraged the patriotic instincts
of the people by constantly presiding at their shooting-practice. The
Swedish forces, after taking Constance, advanced as far as the
Valtelin, and Tirol was threatened with invasion on both sides at once.
By her skilful measures, at every rumour of an inroad, the mountains
bristled with the unerring marksmen of Tirol, securely stationed at
their posts inaccessible to lowlanders. Nothing was spared to keep up
the vigilance and spirit of the true-hearted peasants. By this constant
watchfulness she saved the country from the horrors of war, in which
almost the whole of the German Empire was at that time involved. During
all this time she was also developing the internal resources, and
consolidating the administration of the country. Two misfortunes,
however, visited Innsbruck during her reign: a terrible pestilence, and
a destructive fire in which the Burg suffered severely, the beautiful
chapel of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>Ferdinand II. being consumed, and the body of
Leopold, her husband, which was lying there at the time, rescued with
difficulty. After this, Claudia spent some little time at Botzen, and
also visited Florence. It may be questioned whether the introduction of
the numerous Italians about her court was altogether for the benefit of
Tirol. They brought with them certain ways and principles which were
not altogether in accordance with the German character; and we have
seen the effect of the jealousies of race in the tragic fate of her
chancellor Biener.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4890src" href=
"#xd21e4890" name="xd21e4890src">14</a></p>
<p>Ferdinand Karl having attained his majority in 1646, Claudia
withdrew from public affairs, and died only two years later. In his
reign the introduction of the Italian element at court was apparent in
the greater luxury of its arrangements, and in the greater cultivation
of histrionic and musical diversions. The establishment of the theatre
in Innsbruck is due to him. The marriage of his two sisters, Maria
Leopoldina and Isabella Clara, and the frequent interchange of visits
between him and the princes of Italy, further enlivened Innsbruck. The
visit of Queen Christina,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4895src" href=
"#xd21e4895" name="xd21e4895src">15</a> of which I have already said
enough for my limits, also took place in his reign (1655). Nor did
Ferdinand Karl give himself up to amusement to the neglect of business,
or of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>more manly pleasures. He maintained all his
mother&rsquo;s measures for the encouragement of the <i lang=
"de"><span class="corr" id="xd21e4904" title=
"Source: Schiebenschiessen">Scheibenschiessen</span></i>, and had the
satisfaction of seeing the departure of the enemy&rsquo;s army from his
borders, which was celebrated by the building of
Mari&auml;h&uuml;lfskirche.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4907src" href=
"#xd21e4907" name="xd21e4907src">16</a> To his love of the national
sport of chamois-hunting his death has to be ascribed; for the neglect
of an attack of illness while out on a mountain expedition near Kaltern
after the wild game, gave it a hold on his constitution, which placed
him beyond recovery. His death occurred in 1660, at the early age of
thirty-four; he left no heir.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by his only brother, Sigmund Franz, Bishop of Gurk,
Augsburg, and Trent, who seems to have inherited all his mother&rsquo;s
finer qualities without sharing her Italianizing tendencies. With a
perhaps too sudden sternness, he purged the court and government of all
foreign admixture, and reduced the sumptuous suite of his brother to
dimensions dictated by usefulness alone. However popular this may have
made him with the German population, the ousted Italians were furious;
and his sudden death&mdash;which occurred while, after the pattern of
his father, applying for a dispensation to marry, in 1665&mdash;was by
the Germans ascribed to secret poisoning; his Tuscan physician Agricola
having, it is alleged, been bribed to perpetrate the misdeed.</p>
<p>Tirol now once more reverted to the Empire. Though Leopold I. came
to Innsbruck to receive the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href=
"#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>homage of the people on his
accession, and a gay ceremonial ensued, yet it lost much of its
importance by having no longer a resident court. While there, however,
Leopold had seen the beautiful daughter of Ferdinand Karl&rsquo;s
widow, Claudia Felicit&agrave;, who made such an impression upon him,
that he married her on the death of his first wife. The ceremony was
performed in Innsbruck by proxy only; but the dowager-archduchess
provided great f&ecirc;tes, in which the city readily concurred, and
gave the bride thirty thousand <i lang="de">gulden</i> for her wedding
present. Claudia Felicit&agrave;, in her state at Vienna, did not
forget the good town of Innsbruck; and by her interest with her
husband, Tirol received a Statthalter in the person of Charles Duke of
Lotharingia, husband of his sister Eleonora Maria, widow of the King of
Poland. Charles took up his residence at Innsbruck; and though he was
often absent with the army, the presence of his family revived the
gaiety of the town; still it was not like the old days of the court.
Charles, however, who had been originally educated for the
ecclesiastical state, was a sovereign of unexceptionable principles and
sound judgment; and he did many things for the benefit of Tirol,
particularly in developing its educational establishments. He raised
the Jesuit gymnasium of Innsbruck to the character of a university; and
the privileges with which he endowed it, added to the salubrity of the
situation, attracted alumni from far and near, who amounted to near a
thousand in number. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286"
name="pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>Nothing of note occurred in Tirol till 1703&mdash;the Duke of
Lotharingia had died in 1696&mdash;which is a memorable year. The war
of the Spanish Succession, at that time, found Maximilian, Elector of
Bavaria, and some of the Italian princes, allied with France against
Austria&mdash;thus there were antagonists of Austria on both sides of
Tirol; nevertheless, no attack on it seems to have been apprehended;
and thus, when a plan was concerted for entering Austria by Carinthia
(the actual boundaries against Bavaria being too well defended to
invite an entrance that way), and it was arranged that the Bavarian and
Italian allies should assist the French in overrunning Tirol, everyone
was taken by surprise. Maximilian easily overcame the small frontier
garrison. At Kufstein he met a momentary check, but an accident put the
fortress in his power. Possessed of this base of operations, he was not
long in reducing the forts of Rottenburg Scharnitz, and Ehrenberg, and
possessing himself of Hall and Innsbruck. He now reckoned the country
his, and that it only remained to send news of his success to
Vend&ocirc;me, who had taken W&auml;lsch-Tirol similarly by surprise
and advanced as far as Trent, in order to carry out their concerted
inroad through the Pusterthal. So sure of his victory was he, that he
ordered the Te Deum to be sung in all the churches of Innsbruck.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Tirolese had recovered from their surprise, and
had taken measures for disconcerting <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>and routing the
invaders; the storm-bells and the <i lang=
"de">Kreidenfeuer</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4929src" href=
"#xd21e4929" name="xd21e4929src">17</a> rallied every man capable of
bearing arms, to the defence of his country. The main road over the
Brenner was quickly invested by the native sharp-shooters; there was no
chance of passing <i>that</i> way. Maximilian thought to elude the
vigilance of the people by sending his men round by Oberinnthal and the
Finsterm&uuml;nz. The party trusted with this mission were commanded by
a Bavarian and a French officer. They reached Landeck in safety, but
all around them the sturdy Tirolese were determining their destruction.
Martin Sterzinger, <i lang="de">Pfleger</i> or Judge, of Landeck,
summoned the <i lang="de">Landsturm</i> of the neighbouring districts,
and arranged the plan of operation. The enemy were suffered to advance
on their way unhindered along the steep path, where the rocky sides of
the Inn close in and form the terrible gorge which is traversed by the
Pontlatzerbr&uuml;cke; but when they arrived, no bridge was there! The
mountaineers had been out in the night and cut it down. Beyond this
point the steep side afforded no footing on the right bank, no means
remained of crossing over to the left! The remnants of the bridge
betrayed what had befallen, and quickly the command was given to turn
back; in the panic of the moment many lost their footing, and rolled
into the rapid river beneath. For those even who retained their
composure no return was possible; the heights above were peopled with
the ready Tirolese, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288"
name="pb288">288</a>]</span>burning to defend their country. Down came
their shots like hail, each ball piercing its man; those who had no
arms dashed down stones upon the foe. Only a handful escaped, but at
Landeck these were taken prisoners; and there was not <i>one</i> even
to carry the news to Maximilian. This famous success is still
celebrated every year on the 1st of July by a solemn procession.</p>
<p>Maximilian and Vend&ocirc;me remained perplexed at hearing nothing
from each other, and without means of communication; in vain they sent
out scouts; money could not buy information from the patriotic
Tirolese. Meantime, danger was thickening round each; the <i lang=
"de">Landsturm</i> was out, and every height was beset with agile
climbers, armed with their unerring carbines, and with masses of rock
to hurl down on the enemy who ventured along the road beneath them. The
Bavarian and French leaders in the north and in the south only
perceived how critical was their situation just in time to escape from
it, and the waste and havoc they had made during their brief incursion
was recompensed by the numbers lost in their retreat. The Bavarians
held Kufstein for some time longer, but their precipitate withdrawal
from all the rest of the country earned for the campaign, in the mouths
of the Tirolese, the nickname of the <i lang=
"de">Baierische-Rumpel</i>. While brave arms had been defending the
mountain passes, brave hearts of those whose arms were nerved only for
being lifted up in prayer, not for war, were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>day
by day earnestly interceding in the churches for the deliverance of
their husbands, fathers, and brothers; and when, on the 26th of July,
the land was found free of the foe, it was gratefully remembered that
it was S. Anne&rsquo;s Day, and the so-called <i lang="de"><span class=
"corr" id="xd21e4963" title=
"Source: Annensa&uuml;le">Annens&auml;ule</span></i>, which adorns the
<i lang="de">Neustadt</i>&mdash;the principal thoroughfare of
Innsbruck&mdash;was erected in commemoration.</p>
<p>It is composed of the marbles of the country; the lower part red,
the column white, the effigy of the Immaculate Conception, which
surmounts it and the surrounding rays, in gilt bronze. Round the base
stand St. Vigilius and St. Cassian (two apostles of Tirol), and St.
Anne and St. George; about them float angels, in the breezy style of
the period. The monument was solemnly inaugurated on S. Anne&rsquo;s
Day, 1706; and every year on that day a procession winds round it from
the parish church, singing hymns of thanksgiving; and an altar, gaily
dressed with fresh flowers, stands before it for eight days under the
open sky.</p>
<p>Leopold I. died in 1705, and was succeeded by his son, Joseph I.,
who reigned only six years. Charles VI., Leopold&rsquo;s younger son,
followed, who appointed Karl Philipp, Palsgrave of Neuburg, Governor of
Tirol. He was another pious ruler, and much beloved by the people; his
memory being the more endeared to them, that he was their last
independent prince. His reign benefited Innsbruck by the erection of
the handsome <i lang="de">Landhaus</i> and the <i lang=
"de">Gymnasium</i>, and also by the extensive restoration of the
Pfarrkirche. This occupied the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290"
href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>site of the little chapel,
the accorded privilege to which of hearing in it masses of obligation
forms the earliest record of Innsbruck&rsquo;s history. It had grown
with the growth of the town, and had been added to by various
sovereigns, and we have seen it gifted with Kranach&rsquo;s <i lang=
"de">Mari&auml;hilf</i>. The earthquakes of 1667 and 1689 had left it
so dilapidated, however, that Karl Philipp resolved to rebuild it on a
much larger plan. He laid the first stone on May 12, 1717, in presence
of his brother, the Bishop of Augsburg, and it was consecrated in 1724.
It has the costliness and the vices of its date; its overloaded stucco
ornaments are redeemed by the lavish use of the beautiful marbles of
the country; the quarrying and fashioning these marbles occupied a
hundred workmen, without counting labourers and apprentices, for the
whole time during which the church was building. The frescoes setting
forth the wonder-working patronage of St. James, on the roof and
cupola, are by Kosmas Damian Asam, whose pencil, and that of his two
sons, Kosmas and Egid, were entirely devoted to the decoration of
churches and religious houses. There is a tradition, that as the
fervent painter was putting the finishing touches to the figure of the
saint, as he appears, mounted on his spirited charger as the patron of
Compostella, in the cupola, he stepped back to see the effect of his
work. Forgetting in his zeal the narrowness of the platform on which he
stood, he would inevitably have been precipitated on to the pavement
below, but that the strong arm of the saint <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>he
had been painting so lovingly, detached itself from the wall, and saved
his client from the terrible fate!<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4987src"
href="#xd21e4987" name="xd21e4987src">18</a> Other works of this reign
were the <i lang="de">Strafarbeitshaus</i>, a great improvement on the
former prison; and the church of St. John Nepomuk, in the Innrain, then
a new and fashionable street. The canonization of the great martyr to
the seal of Confession took place in 1730. Though properly a Bohemian
saint, his memory is so beloved all through southern Germany, that all
its divisions seem to lay a patriotic claim to him. His canonization
was celebrated by a solemn function in the Pfarrkirche, lasting eight
days; and the people were so stirred up to fervour by its observance,
that they subscribed for the building of a church in his honour, the
governor taking the lead in promoting it.</p>
<p>Maria Theresa succeeded her father, Charles VI., in 1742. She seems
to have known how to attend to the affairs of every part of the Empire
alike; and thus, while the whole country felt the benefit of her wise
provisions, all the former splendours of the Tirolean capital revived.
Maria Theresa frequently took up her residence at Innsbruck; and while
benefiting trade by her expenditure, and by that of the visitors whom
her court attracted, she set at the same time an edifying <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>example of piety and a well-regulated life. Her
associations with Innsbruck were nevertheless overshadowed by sad
events more than once, though this does not appear to have diminished
her affection for the place.</p>
<p>When Marshal Daun took a whole division of the Prussian army captive
at Maxen in 1758, the officers, nine in number, were sent to Innsbruck
for safe custody. Here they remained till the close of the war, five
years later. This, and the furnishing some of its famous sharpshooters
to the Austrian contingent, was the only contact Tirol had with the
Seven Years&rsquo; War. Two years after (1765) Maria Theresa arranged
that the marriage of her son (afterwards Leopold II.) with Maria Luisa,
daughter of Charles III. of Spain, should take place there. The
townspeople, sensible of the honour conferred on them, responded to it
by adorning the city with the most festive display; not only with gay
banners and hangings, but by improving the fa&ccedil;ades of their
houses, and the roads and bridges, and erecting a triumphal arch of
unusual solidity at the end of the Neustadt nearest Wilten, being that
by which the royal pair would pass on their way from Italy; for Leopold
was then Grand Duke of Tuscany. The theatre and public buildings were
likewise put in order. Maria Theresa, with her husband Francis I., and
all the Imperial family, arrived in Innsbruck on July 15, attracting a
larger assemblage of great people than had been seen there even in its
palmiest days. Banquets and gay doings filled up the interval till
August 5, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>when Leopold and Maria Luisa made their entrance
with unexampled pomp. The marriage was celebrated in the <i lang=
"de">Pfarrkirche</i> by Prince Clement of Saxony, Bishop of Ratisbon,
assisted by seven other bishops. Balls, operas, banquets,
illuminations, and the national <i lang="de">Freischiessen</i>,
followed. But during all these f&ecirc;tes, an unseasonable gloom,
which is popularly supposed to bode evil, overclouded the August sky,
usually so clear and brilliant in Innsbruck. On the 18th, a grand opera
was given to conclude the festivities; on his way back from it Francis
I. was seized with a fit, and died in the course of the night in the
arms of his son, afterwards Joseph II.</p>
<p>Though Maria Theresa&rsquo;s master mind had caused her to take the
lead in all public matters, she was devotedly attached to her husband,
and this sudden blow was severely felt by her. She could not bear that
the room in which he expired should ever be again used for secular
purposes, and had it converted into a costly chapel; at the same time
she made great improvements and additions to the rest of the Burg. She
always wore mourning to the end of her life, and always, when state
affairs permitted, passed the eighteenth day of every month in prayer
and retirement. A remarkable monument remains of both the affection and
public spirit of this talented princess. Driving out to the Abbey of
Wilten in one of the early days of mourning, while some of the tokens
of the rejoicing, so unexpectedly turned into lamentation, were still
unremoved, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>the sight of the handsome triumphal arch
reminded her of a resolution suggested by Francis I. to replace it by
one of similar design in more permanent materials. Her first impulse
was to reject the thought as a too painful reminder of the past; but
reflection on the promised benefit to the town prevailed over personal
feelings, and she gave orders for the execution of the work; but to
make it a fitting memorial of the occasion, she ordered that while the
side facing the road from Italy should be a <i lang=
"de">Triumphpforte</i>, and recall by its bas-reliefs the glad occasion
which caused its erection, the side facing the town should be a
<i lang="de">Trauerpforte</i>, and set forth the melancholy conclusion
of the same. The whole was executed by Tirolean artists, and of
Tirolean marbles. She founded also a <i lang="de">Damenstift</i>, for
the maintenance of twelve poor ladies of noble birth, who, without
taking vows, bound themselves to wear mourning and pray for the soul of
Francis I. and those of his house. Another great work of Maria Theresa
was the development she gave to the University of Innsbruck.</p>
<p>After her death, which took place in 1780, Joseph II., freed from
the restraints of her influence, gave full scope to his plans for
meddling with ecclesiastical affairs, for which his intercourse with
Russia had perhaps given him a taste. Pius VI. did not spare himself a
journey to Vienna, to exert the effect of his personal influence with
the Emperor, who it would seem did not pay much heed to his advice, and
so disaffected his people by his injudicious innovations, that at the
time of his death <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295"
name="pb295">295</a>]</span>the whole empire, which the skill of Maria
Theresa had consolidated, was in a state of complete
disorganization.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5024src" href="#xd21e5024"
name="xd21e5024src">19</a> Though increased by his ill-gotten share of
Poland, he lost the Low Countries, and Hungary was so disaffected, that
had he not been removed by the hand of death (1790), it is not
improbable it would have thrown off its allegiance also. Leopold II.,
his brother, who only reigned two years, saved the empire from
dissolution by prudent concessions, by rescinding many of
Joseph&rsquo;s hasty measures, and abandoning his policy of
centralization.</p>
<p>One religious house which Joseph II. did not suppress was the
<i lang="de">Damenstift</i> of Innsbruck, of which his sister, the
Archduchess Maria Elizabeth, undertook the government in 1781; and
during the remainder of her life held a sort of court there which was
greatly for the benefit of the city. Pius VI. visited her on his way
back from Vienna on the evening of May 7, 1782. The whole town was
illuminated, and all the religious in the town went out to meet him,
followed by the whole body of the people. Late as was the hour (a
quarter to ten, says a precise chronicle) he had no sooner reached the
apartment prepared for him in the Burg, than he admitted whole crowds
to audience, and the enthusiasm with which the religious Tirolese
thronged round him surpasses words. Many, possessed with a sense of the
honour of having the vicar of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296"
href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>Christ in their very midst,
remained all night in the surrounding <i lang="de">Rennplatz</i>, as it
were on guard round his abode. In the morning, after hearing mass, he
imparted the Apostolic Benediction from the balcony of the Burg, and
proceeded on his way over the Brenner.</p>
<p>Leopold II. had not been three months on the throne before he came
to Innsbruck to receive the homage of his loyal Tirolese, who took this
opportunity of winning from him the abrogation of many <i lang=
"de">Josephinischen</i> measures, particularly that reducing their
University to a mere Lyceum. He was succeeded in 1792 by his son,
Francis II.; but the mighty storm of the French Revolution was
threatening, and absorbed all his attention with the preservation of
his empire, and the defence of Tirol seems to have been overlooked.
Year by year danger gathered round the outskirts of her mountain
fastnesses. Whole hosts were engaged all around; yet there were but a
handful, five thousand at most, of Austrian troops stationed within her
frontier. The importance of obtaining the command of such a base of
operations, which would at once have afforded a key to Italy and
Austria, did not escape Bonaparte. Joubert was sent with fifteen
thousand men to gain possession of the country, and advanced as far as
Sterzing. Innsbruck was thrown into a complete panic, and I am sorry to
have to record that the Archduchess Maria Elizabeth took her flight.
The Austrian Generals, Kerpen and Laudon, did not deem it prudent, with
their small contingent, to engage the French army. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>Nevertheless, the Tirolese, instead of being
disheartened at this pusillanimity, with their wonted spirit rose as
one man; a decisive battle was fought at Spinges, a hamlet near
Sterzing, where a village girl fought so bravely, and urged the men on
to the defence of their country so generously, that though her name is
lost, her courage won her a local reputation as lasting as that of Joan
of Arc or the &lsquo;Maid of Zaragoza,&rsquo; under the title of
<i lang="de">Das M&auml;dchen von Spinges</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5051src" href="#xd21e5051" name="xd21e5051src">20</a> Driven out
hence, the French troops made the best of their way to join the main
army in Carinthia. After this the enemy left Tirol at Peace for some
years, with the exception of one or two border inroads, which were
resolutely repulsed. One of these is so characteristic of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>the
religious customs of Tirol, that, though not strictly belonging to the
history of Innsbruck, I cannot forbear mentioning it. The French, under
Massena, had in 1799 been twice repulsed from Feldkirch with great
loss. Divisions which had never known a reverse were decimated and
routed by the practised guns of the mountaineers. Thinking their
victory assured, the peasants, after the manner of volunteer troops,
had dispersed but too soon, to return to their flocks and tillage.
Warily perceiving his advantage, Massena led his troops back over the
border silently by night, intending in the morning to take the
unsuspecting town by storm&mdash;a plan which did not seem to have a
chance of failure. But it happened to be Holy Saturday. Suddenly, just
as he was about to give the order for the attack, the bells of all the
churches far and near, which had been so still during the preceding
days, burst all together upon his ear with the jubilant <i lang=
"de">Auferstehungsfeier</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5063src" href=
"#xd21e5063" name="xd21e5063src">21</a> General and troops, alike
unfamiliar with religious times and seasons, took the sound for the
alarm bells calling out the <i lang="de">Landsturm</i>. In the belief
that they were betrayed, a precipitate retreat was ordered. But the
night no longer covered the march; and the peasants, who were gathered
in their villages for the Offices of the Church, were quickly collected
for the pursuit. This abortive expedition cost the French army three
thousand men. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the meantime the Archduchess had returned to Innsbruck, and all
went on upon its old footing, as if there were no enemy to fear. So
little was another disturbance expected, that the Archduchess devoted
herself to the promotion of local improvements, including that of the
<i lang="de">Gottesacker</i>. This is one of the favourite Sunday
afternoon resorts of the Innsbruckers, and is well worthy of a visit.
The site was first destined for the purpose by the Emperor Maximilian.
It was gifted with all the indulgences accorded to the Campo Santo of
Rome by the Pope, and in token of the same some earth from San Lorenzo
<i lang="it"><span class="corr" id="xd21e5076" title=
"Source: fuor">fuori</span> le mura</i> was brought hither at the time
of its consecration by the Bishop of Brixen in 1510. It has, according
to the frequent German arrangement, an upper and a lower chapel; the
former, dedicated to S. Anne; the latter, as usual, to S. Michael,
though the people commonly call it <i lang="de">die Veitskapelle</i>,
on account of some cures of S. Vitus&rsquo; dance wrought here. The
arcades which now surround the cemetery were the result of the
introduction of Italian customs later in the sixteenth century. Some of
the oldest and noblest names of Tirol are to be found upon the
monuments here, some of which cannot fail to attract attention. The
bas-reliefs sculptured by Collin for that of the Hohenhauser family,
and those he prepared for his own, may be reckoned among his
masterpieces. Some which are adorned with paintings would be very
interesting if the weather had spared them more. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>Archduchess had prepared her own resting-place
here also, but was not destined to occupy it. The disastrous defeat of
Austerlitz filled her with alarm, and she once more fled from
Innsbruck, this time not to return.</p>
<p>This was the year 1805, and a sad one it was for Tirol. The treaty
of Pressburg had given Tirol to Bavaria, and Bavaria and Tirol had
never in any age been able to understand each other. Willingly would
the Tirolese have opposed their entrance; but the Bavarians, who knew
every pass as well as themselves, were enabled to pour in the allied
troops under Marshal Ney in such force, that they were beyond their
power to resist. The fortresses near the Bavarian frontier were razed,
and Innsbruck occupied. On February 11, 1806, Marshal Ney left, and the
town was formally delivered over to Bavarian rule. The most unpopular
changes of government were adopted, particularly in ecclesiastical
matters and in forcing the peasants into the army; the University also
was once more made into a Lyceum. But the Landsturm was not idle, and
the Archduke Johann, Leopold&rsquo;s brother, came into Tirol to
encourage them. Maturing their plans in secret, the patriots, under
Andreas Hofer, who had been to Vienna in January to declare his plans
and get them confirmed by his government, and Speckbacher, broke into
Innsbruck on April 13, 1809, where the townspeople received them with
loud acclamations; and after a desperate and celebrated conflict at
Berg Isel, succeeded in completely ridding it of the invaders.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>The Bavarian arms on the Landhaus were shattered
to atoms, and when the Eagle replaced them, the people climbed the
ladders to kiss it. This was the first great act of the <i lang=
"de">Befreiungsk&auml;mpfe</i> which have made &lsquo;the year
Nine&rsquo; memorable in the annals of Tirol, and, I may say of Europe,
for it was one of the noblest struggles of determined patriotism those
annals have to boast, and at the same time the most successful effort
of volunteer arms. Hofer accepted the title of <i lang=
"de">Sch&uuml;tzenkommandant</i>, and was lodged in the imperial
<i lang="de">Burg</i>, while his peasant neighbours took the office of
guards; but he altered nothing of his simple habits, nor his national
costume. His frugal expenses amounted to forty-five kreuzers a day, and
he lost no opportunity of expressing that he did nothing on his own
account, but all in the name of the Emperor. On May 19 the Bavarians
laid siege to the town; but the defenders of the country, supported by
a few regular Austrian troops, obliged them by the end of a fortnight
to decamp. On June 30 they returned with a force of twenty-four
thousand men; but other feats of arms of the patriots in all parts of
Tirol showed that its people were unconquerable, and for the third time
Hofer took possession of Innsbruck. In the meantime, however, the Peace
of Sch&ouml;nbrunn, of October 25, had nullified their achievements,
though the memory of their bravery could never be blotted out, and
always asserted its power. Nor could the brave people, even when bidden
by the Emperor himself to desist, believe <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>that his orders were
otherwise than wrung from him, nor could their loyalty be quenched.
Hofer&rsquo;s stern sense of subordination made him advise abstention
from further strife, but the more ardent patriots refused to listen,
and ended by leading him to join them. A desultory warfare was now kept
up, with no very effectual result, but yet with a spirit and
determination which convinced the Bavarians that they could never
subdue such a people, and predisposed them to consent to the evacuation
of their country in 1814; for they saw that</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Freedom from every hut</p>
<p class="line xd21e1303">Sent down a separate root,</p>
<p class="line">And when base swords her branches cut,</p>
<p class="line xd21e1303">With tenfold might they shoot.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the meantime a terrible wrong had been committed;
the French, knowing the value of Hofer&rsquo;s influence in encouraging
the country-people against them, set a price on his head sufficient to
tempt a traitor to make know his hiding-place. He was taken, and thrown
into prison at the <i lang="it">Porta Molina</i> at Mantua. Tried in a
council of war, several voices were raised in honour of his bravery and
patriotism; a small majority, however, had the cowardice to condemn him
to death. He received the news of the sentence with the firmness which
might have been expected of him, the only favour he condescended to ask
being the spiritual assistance of a priest. Provost Manifesti was sent
to him, and remained with him to the end. An offer was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>made
him of saving his life by entering the French service, but he
indignantly refused to join the enemies of his country. To Provost
Manifesti he committed all he possessed, to be expended in the relief
of his fellow-countrymen who were prisoners. He spent the early hours
of the morning of the day on which he was to die, after mass, in
writing his farewell to his wife, bidding her not to give way to grief,
and to his other relations and friends, in which latter category was
comprehended the population of the whole Passeyerthal, not to say all
Tirol; recommending himself to their prayers, and begging that his name
might be given out, and the suffrages of the faithful asked for him, in
the village church where he had so often knelt in years of peace. He
was forbidden to address his fellow-prisoners. He bore a crucifix,
wreathed in flowers, in his hand as he walked to the place of
execution, which he was observed repeatedly to kiss. There he took a
little silver crucifix from his neck, a memorial of his first
Communion, and gave it to Provost Manifesti. He refused to kneel, or to
have his eyes bandaged, but stood without flinching to receive the fire
of his executioners. His signal to them was first a brief prayer; then
a fervently uttered &lsquo;<i lang="de">Hoch lebe Kaiser
Franz!</i>&rsquo; and then the firm command, &lsquo;Fire home!&rsquo;
His courage, however, unmanned the soldiers; ashamed of their task,
they durst not take secure aim, and it took thirteen shots to send the
undaunted soul of the peasant hero to its rest. It was February 20,
1810; he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>only forty-five. The traditions of his courage
and endurance, his probity and steadfastness, are manifold; but in
connexion with Innsbruck we have only to speak of his brief
administration there, which was untarnished by a single unworthy deed,
a single act of severity towards prisoners of war, of whom he had
numbers in his power who had dealt cruel havoc on his beloved
valleys.</p>
<p>The Emperor for whom he had fought so nobly returned to Innsbruck,
to receive the homage of the Tirolese, on May 28, 1816, amid the loud
rejoicings of the people, preceded by a solemn service of thanksgiving
in the <i lang="de">Pfarrkirche</i>. Illuminations and f&ecirc;tes
followed till June 5, when the ceremony was wound up by a grand
shooting-match, at which the Emperor presided and many prizes were
distributed. The number who contended was 3,678, and 2,137 of them made
the bull&rsquo;s-eye; among them were old men over eighty and boys of
thirteen and fourteen.</p>
<p>The claims of Hofer on his country&rsquo;s remembrance were not
forgotten when she once more had leisure for works of peace. His
precious remains, which had been carefully interred by the priest who
consoled his last moments at Mantua, were brought to Innsbruck in 1823,
and laid temporarily in the <i lang="de">Servitenkloster</i>. On
February 21 they were borne in solemn procession by six of his brothers
in arms, all the clergy and people following. The Abbot of Wilten sang
the requiem office. The Emperor ordered the conspicuous and appropriate
monument to mark the spot where they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>laid him, which is
one of the chief ornaments of the <i lang="de">Hofkirche</i>. The
pedestal bears the inscription&mdash;</p>
<div lang="de" class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Seinen in den Befreiungsk&auml;mpfen gefallenen
S&ouml;hnen das dankbare Vaterland,</p>
</div>
<p>and the sarcophagus the words&mdash;</p>
<div lang="la" class="blockquote">

</div>
<p>Tirol had no reason to regret the restoration of the dynasty for
which she had suffered so much. Most of her ancient privileges were
restored to her, and in 1826 Innsbruck again received the honour of a
University, and many useful institutions were founded. Francis came to
Innsbruck again this year, and while there, received the visit of the
Emperor of Russia and the King of Prussia. Another shooting-match was
held before them, at which the precision of the Tirolese received much
praise; and again for a short time in 1835. The Archduke John, who came
in 1835 to live in Tirol, was received with great enthusiasm; his hardy
feats of mountain climbing, and hearty accessible character, endearing
him to all the people.</p>
<p>The troubles of 1848 gave the Tirolese again an opportunity of
showing that their ancient loyalty was undiminished. The Emperor
Ferdinand, driven out of his capital, found that he had not reckoned
wrongly in counting on a secure refuge in Tirol. It was the evening of
May 16 that the Imperial pair came as fugitives to Innsbruck. Though
there was hardly time to announce their advent before their arrival,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>the people went out to meet them, took their
horses from the carriage, and themselves drew it into the town; and all
the time they remained the towns-people and <i lang="de"><span class=
"corr" id="xd21e5153" title=
"Source: Landes-sch&uuml;ten">Landes-sch&uuml;tzen</span></i> mounted
guard round the Burg. More than this, the Tirolese <i lang=
"de">Kaiser-J&auml;ger-Regiment</i> volunteered for service against the
insurgents, and fought with such determination that Marshal Radetsky
pronounced that every man of them was a hero. With equal
stout-heartedness the <i lang="de">Landes-sch&uuml;tzen</i> repelled
the attempted Italian invasion at several points of the south-western
frontier, and kept the enemy at bay till the imperial troops could
arrive. These services were renewed with equal fidelity the next year.
A tablet recording the bravery of those who fell in this
campaign&mdash;one of the officers engaged being Hofer&rsquo;s
grandson&mdash;is let into the wall of the Hofkirche opposite
Hofer&rsquo;s monument.</p>
<p>It was this Emperor from whom the name of Ferdinandeum was given to
the Museum, but it was rather out of compliment, and while he was yet
Crown-Prince, than in memory of any signal co-operation on his part. It
was projected in 1820 by Count Von Chotek, then Governor of Tirol. It
comprises an association for the promotion of the study of the arts and
sciences. The Museum contains several early illuminated MSS., in the
production of which the Carthusians of Schnals and the Dominicans of
Botzen acquired a singular pre-eminence. At a time when the nobles of
other countries were occupied with far less enlightened pursuits,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>the peaceful condition of Tirol enabled its
nobles, such as the <i lang="de">Edelherrn</i> of Monlan, Annaberg,
Dornsberg, Runglstein, and others, to keep in their employment
secretaries, copyists, and chaplains, busied in transcribing; and often
sent them into other countries to make copies of famous works to enrich
their collections. It has also some of the first works produced from
the printing-press of Schwatz already mentioned. This press was removed
to Innsbruck in 1529; Trent set one up about the same time. In the
lower rooms of the Ferdinandeum is a collection of paintings by
Tirolean artists, and specimens of the marbles, minerals, and other
natural productions of the country. The great variation in the
elevation of the soil affords a vast range to the vegetable kingdom, so
that it can boast of giving a home to plants like the tobacco, which
only germinates at a temperature of seventy degrees, and the edelweiss,
which only blossoms under the snow. There is also a small collection of
Roman and earlier antiquities, dug up at various times in different
parts of Tirol, and specimens of native industries. Among the most
singular items are some paintings on cobweb, of which one family has
possessed the secret for generations, specimens of their works may be
found in most of the museums of South Germany; these almost self-taught
artists display great dexterity in the management of their strange
canvas, and considerable merit in the delicate manipulation of their
pigments; sometimes they even imitate fine line engravings in pen
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>and ink without injuring the fragile surface.
They delight specially in treating subjects of traditional interest, as
Kaiser Max on the Martinswand, the beautiful Philippine Welser, the
heroic Hofer, and the patron saints and particular devotions of their
village sanctuaries. Kranach&rsquo;s Mari&auml;hilf is thus an object
of most affectionate care. The &lsquo;web&rsquo; is certainly like that
of no ordinary spider; but it is reported that this family has
cultivated a particular species for the purpose, and an artist friend
who had been in Mexico mentioned to me having seen there
spiders&rsquo;-webs almost as solid as these. I was not able, however,
to learn any tradition of the importation of these spiders from Mexico.
In the first room on the second floor are to be seen the characteristic
letter written, as I have said, by Hofer, shortly before his end, and
other relics of him and the other patriots, such as the hat and
breviary of the Franciscan Haspinger. Also an Italian gun taken by the
<i lang="de">Akademische Legion</i>&mdash;the band of loyal volunteer
students of Innsbruck university, in the campaign of 1848&mdash;and I
think some trophies also of the success of Tirolese arms against the
attempted invasion of the later Italian war, in which as usual the
skill of these people as marksmen stood them in good stead. Anyone who
wishes to judge of their practice may have plenty of opportunity in
Innsbruck, for their rifles seem to be constantly firing away at the
<i lang="de">Schiess-stand</i>; so constantly as to form an annoyance
to those who are not interested in the subject. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span></p>
<p>This <i lang="de">Schiess-stand</i>, or rifle-butt, was set up in
1863, in commemoration of the fifth centenary of Tirol&rsquo;s union
with Austria and its undeviating loyalty. No history presents an
instance of a loyalty more intimately connected with religious
principle than the loyalty of Tirol; the two traditions are so
inseparably interwoven that the one cannot be wounded without
necessarily injuring the other. The present Emperor and Empress of
Austria are not wanting to the devout example of their predecessors,
but the modern theory of government leaves them little influence in the
administration of their dominions. Meantime the anti-Catholic policy of
the Central Government creates great dissatisfaction and uneasiness in
Tirol. Other divisions of the empire had been prepared for such by
laxity of manners and indifferentism to religious belief&mdash;the
detritus, which the flood of the French revolution scattered more or
less thickly over the whole face of Europe. But the valleys of Tirol
had closed their passes to the inroads of this flood, and laws not
having religion for their basis are there just as obnoxious in the
nineteenth as they would have been in any former century.</p>
<p>In concluding my notice of the capital of Tirol, it may be worth
while to mention that the census of January 1870 gives it a population
(exclusive of military) of 16,810, being an increase of 2,570 over the
twelve preceding years. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href=

writing the above, I have been assured by one who has frequently
conversed with her, that the concealment of her name arose from her own
modesty; it was Katharina Lanz. To avoid public notice, she went to
live at a distance, and up to the time of her death in 1854, bore an
exemplary character, living as housekeeper to the priest serving the
mountain church of S. Vigilius, near Rost, the highest inhabited point
of the Enneberg. When induced to speak of her exploits, she always made
a point of observing that, though she brandished her hay-fork, she
neither actually killed or wounded anyone. She had heard that the
French soldiers were nothing loth to desecrate sacred places, and she
stationed herself in the church porch determined to prevent their
entrance; the churchyard had become the citadel of the villagers. From
her post of observation she saw with dismay that her people were giving
way. It was then she rushed out and rallied them; in her impetuosity
she was <i>very near</i> running her hay-fork through a French soldier,
but she was saved from the deed by her landlord, who, encouraged by her
ardour, struck him down, pushing her aside. The success of her sally
and her subsequent disappearance cast a halo of mystery round her
story, and many were inclined to believe the whole affair was a
heavenly apparition.</p>

<p class="first">Those who wish to visit the legend-homes of Tirol
without any great measure of &lsquo;roughing,&rsquo; will doubtless
find Innsbruck the most convenient base of operations for many
excursions of various lengths to places which the pedestrian would take
on his onward routes. Those on the north and east, which have been
already suggested from Hall and Schwatz, may also be treated thus. It
remains to mention those to be found on the west, north-west, and
south. But first there is M&uuml;hlau, also to the east, reached by an
avenue of poplars between the right bank of the Inn and the railway;
where the river is crossed by a suspension-bridge. There are baths here
which are much visited by the Innsbruckers, and many prefer staying
there to Innsbruck itself. A pretty little new Gothic church adorns the
height; the altar is bright with marbles of the country, and has a very
creditable altar-piece by a Tirolean artist. M&uuml;hlau was celebrated
in the <i lang="de">Befreiungsk&auml;mpfe</i> through the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>courage of Baroness Sternbach, its chief
resident; everywhere the patriots gathered she might have been found in
their midst, fully armed and on her bold charger, inspiring all with
courage. Arrested in her <span lang="fr">ch&acirc;teau</span> at
M&uuml;hlau during the Bavarian occupation, no threats or insult could
wring from her any admission prejudicial to the interests of her
country, or compromising to her son. She was sent to Munich, and kept a
close prisoner there, as also were Graf Sarnthein and Baron Schneeburg,
till the Peace of Vienna.</p>
<p>From either M&uuml;hlau or Innsbruck may be made the excursion to
Frau H&uuml;tt, a curious natural formation which by a freak of nature
presents somewhat the appearance of a gigantic petrifaction of a woman
with a child in her arms. Of it one of the most celebrated of Tirolean
traditions is told. In the time of Noe, says the legend, there was a
queen of the giants living in these mountains, and her name was Frau
H&uuml;tt. Nork makes out a seemingly rather far-fetched derivation for
it out of the wife <i lang="de">der Beh&uuml;tete</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the
behatted, or covered one), otherwise Odin, with the sky for his
head-covering. However that may be, the legend says Frau H&uuml;tt had
a son, a young giant, who wanted to cut down a pine tree to make a
stalking-horse, but as the pine grew on the borders of a morass, he
fell with his burden into the swamp. Covered over head and ears with
mud, he came home crying to his mother, who ordered the nurse to wipe
off the mud with fine crumb of white bread. This filled up the measure
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>of Frau H&uuml;tt&rsquo;s life-long
extravagance. As the servant approached, to put the holy gift of God to
this profane use, a fearful storm came on, and the light of heaven was
veiled by angry clouds; the earth rocked with fear, then opened a
yawning mouth, and swallowed up the splendid marble palace of Frau
H&uuml;tt, and the rich gardens surrounding it. When the sky became
again serene, of all the former verdant beauty nothing remained; all
was wild and barren as at present. Frau H&uuml;tt, who had run for
refuge with her son in her arms to a neighbouring eminence, was turned
into a rock. In place of our &lsquo;Wilful waste makes woeful
want,&rsquo; children in the neighbourhood are warned from waste by the

"#xd21e5229" name="xd21e5229src">1</a> Frau H&uuml;tt also serves as
the popular barometer of Innsbruck; and when the old giantess appears
with her &lsquo;night-cap&rsquo; on, no one undertakes a journey. This
excursion will take four or five hours. On the way, B&uuml;chsenhausen
is passed, where, as I have already mentioned, Gregory L&ouml;ffler
cast the statues of the Hofkirche. I have also given already the legend
of the Bienerweible. As a consequence of the state execution which
occasioned her melancholy aberrations, the castle was forfeited to the
crown. Ferdinand Karl, however, restored it to the family. It was
subsequently sold, and became one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313"
href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>of the most esteemed
breweries of the country, the cellars being hewn in the living rock;
and its &lsquo;<span lang="de">Biergarten</span>&rsquo; is much
frequented by holiday-makers. Remains of the old castle are still kept
up; among them the chapel, in which are some paintings worth attention.
On one of the walls is a portrait of the Chancellor&rsquo;s son, who
died in the Franciscan Order in Innsbruck, in his ninety-first
year.</p>
<p>If time allows, the Weierburg and the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e5243" title="Source: Maria-Br&uuml;un">Maria-Brunn</span> may be
taken in the way home, as it makes but a slight digression; or it may
be ascended from M&uuml;hlau. The so-called M&uuml;hlauer Klamm is a
picturesque gorge, and the torrent running through it forms some
cascades. Weierburg affords a most delightful view of the picturesque
capital, and the surrounding heights and valleys mapped out around.
Schloss Weierburg was once the gay summer residence of the Emperor
Maximilian, and some relics of him are still preserved there.</p>
<p>Hottingen, which might be either taken on the way when visiting Frau
H&uuml;tt or the Weierburg, is a sheltered spot, and one of the few in
the Innthal where the vine flourishes. It is reached by continuing the
road past the little Church of Mari&auml;hilf across the Inn; it had
considerable importance in medi&aelig;val times, and has consequently
some interesting remains, which, as well as the bathing establishment,
make it a rival to M&uuml;hlau. In the church (dedicated to St.
Nicholas) is Gregory L&ouml;ffler&rsquo;s monument, erected to him by
his two sons. The Count of Trautmannsdorf and other noble <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>families of Tirol have monuments in the
Friedhof. The tower of the church is said to be a remnant of a Roman
temple to Diana. To the right of the church is Schloss Lichtenthurm,
well kept up, and often inhabited by the Schneeburg family. On the
woody heights to the north is a little pilgrimage chapel difficult of
access, and called the <i lang="de">H&ouml;ttingerbilde</i>. It is
built over an image of our Lady found on the spot in 1764, by a student
of Innsbruck who ascribed his rapid advance in the schools to his
devotion to it. On the east side of the H&ouml;ttinger stream are some
remains of lateral mining shafts, which afford the opportunity of a
curious and difficult, though not dangerous, exploration. There are
some pretty stalactitic formations, but on a restricted scale.</p>
<p>There is enough of interest in a visit to Zirl to make it the object
of a day&rsquo;s outing; but if time presses it may be reached hence,
by pursuing the main street of this suburb, called, I know not why,
<i lang="de">zum grossen Herr-Gott</i>, which continues in a path along
an almost direct line of about seven miles through field and forest,
and for the last four or five following the bank of the Inn. Or the
whole route may be taken in a carriage from Innsbruck, driving past the
rifle-butt under Mari&auml;hilf. At a distance of two miles you pass
Kranebitten, or Kranewitten, not far from which, at a little distance
on the right of the road, is a remarkable ravine in the heights, which
approach nearer and nearer the bank of the river. It is well worth
while to turn aside and visit this ravine, which goes by the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>name of the <i lang="de">Schwefelloch</i>. It is
an accessible introduction on a small scale to the wild and fearful
natural solitudes we read of with interest in more distant regions. The
uneven path is closed in by steep and rugged mountain sides, which
spontaneously recall many a poet&rsquo;s description of a visit to the
nether world. At some distance down the gorge, a flight of eight or
nine rough and precarious steps cut in the rock, and then one or two
still more precarious ladders, lead to the so-called <i lang=
"de">Hundskirche</i>, or <i lang="de">Hundskapelle</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5270src" href="#xd21e5270" name="xd21e5270src">2</a>
which is said to derive its name from having been the last resort of
Pagan mysteries when heathendom was retreating before the advance of
Christianity in Tirol. Further on, the rocks bear the name of the
Wagnerwand (<i lang="de">Wand</i> being a wall), and the great and
lesser Lehner; and here they seem almost to meet high above you and
throw a strange gloom over your path, and the torrent of the <i lang=
"de">Sulz</i> roars away below in the distance; while the oft-repeated
answering of the echo you evoke is more weird than utter silence. The
path which has hitherto been going north now trends round to the west,
and displays the back of the Martinswand, and the fertile so-called
<i lang="de">Zirlerchristen</i>, soon affording a pleasing view both
ways towards Zirl and Innsbruck. There is rough accommodation here for
the night for those who would ascend the Gross Solstein, 9,393 feet;
the Brandjoch, 7,628 feet; or the Klein Solstein, 8,018
feet&mdash;peaks of the range which keep Bavaria out of Tirol.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>As we proceed again on the road to Zirl, the level space between the
mountains and the river continues to grow narrower and narrower, but
what there is, is every inch cultivated; and soon we pass the <i lang=
"de">Markstein</i> which constitutes the boundary between Ober and
Unter-Innthal. By-and-by the mountain slopes drive the road almost down
to the bank, and straight above you rises the foremost spur of the
Solstein, the Martinswand, so called by reason of its perpendicularity,
celebrated far and wide in <i>Sage</i> and ballad for the hunting
exploit and marvellous preservation of Kaiser Max.</p>
<p>It was Easter Monday, 1490; Kaiser Max was staying at Weierburg, and
started in the early morning on a hunting expedition on the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e5293" title=
"Source: Zirlergebrge">Zirlergebirge</span>. So far there is nothing
very remarkable, for his ardent disposition and love of danger often
carried him on beyond all his suite; but then came a marvellous
accident, the accounts of the origin of which are various. There is no
one in Innsbruck but has a version of his own to tell you. As most
often reported, the chamois he was following led him suddenly down the
very precipice I have described. The steepness of the terrible descent
did not affright him; but in his frantic course one by one the iron
spikes had been wrenched from his soles, till at last just as he
reached a ledge, scarcely a span in breadth, he found he had but one
left. To proceed was impossible, but&mdash;so also was retreat. There
he hung, then, a speck between earth and sky, or as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=

<p class="first">But the singers of the high deeds of Kaiser Max could
not bring themselves to believe that so signal a danger could have
befallen their hero by mere accident. They must discover for it an
origin to connect it with his political importance. Accordingly they
have said that the minions of Sigismund <i lang="de">der
M&uuml;nzreiche</i>, dispossessed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318"
href="#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>at his abdication, had
plotted to lead Max, the strong redresser of wrongs, the last flower of
chivalry, the hope of the Hapsburg House, the mainstay of his century,
into destruction; that it was not that the innocent chamois led the
Kaiser astray, but that the conspirators misled him as to the direction
it had taken.</p>
<p>Certainly, when one thinks of the situation of the empire at that
moment, and of Hungary, the borderland against the Turks, suddenly
deprived of its great King Matthias Corvinus, even while yet at war
with them, only four days before<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5354src"
href="#xd21e5354" name="xd21e5354src">4</a>; when we think that the
writers of the ballad had before their eyes the great amount of good
Maximilian really did effect not only for Tirol, but for the empire and
for Europe, and then contemplated the idea of his career being cut
short thus almost at the outset, we can understand that they deemed it
more consonant with the circumstances to believe so great a peril was
incurred as a consequence of his devotion to duty rather than in the
pursuit of pleasure.</p>
<p>Here, then, he hung; a less fearless hunter might have been overawed
by the prospect or exhausted by the strain. Not so Kaiser Max. He not
only held on steadfastly by the hour, but was able to look round him so
calmly that he at last discerned behind him a cleft in the rock, or
little cave, affording a footing less precarious than that on which he
rested. The ballad may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href=
"#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>be thought to say that it opened
itself to receive him. The rest of the hunting party, even those who
had nerve to follow him to the edge of the crag, could not see what had
become of him. Below, there was no one to think of looking up; and if
there had been, even an emperor could hardly have been discerned at a
height of something like a thousand feet. The horns of the huntsmen,
and the messengers sent in every direction to ask counsel of the most
experienced climbers, within a few hours crowded the banks on both
sides with the loyal and enthusiastic people; till at last the wail of
his faithful subjects, which could be heard a mile off, sent comfort
into the heart of the Kaiser, who stood silent and stedfast, relying on
God and his people. Meantime, the sun had reached the meridian; the
burning rays poured down on the captive, and gradually as the hours
went by the rocks around him grew glowing hot like an oven. Exhausted
by the long fast, no less than the anxiety of his position, and the
sharp run that had preceded the accident, he began to feel his strength
ebbing away. One desire stirred him&mdash;to know whether any help was
possible before the insensibility, which he felt must supervene,
overcame him. Then he bethought him of writing on a strip of parchment
he had about him, to describe his situation, and to ask if there was
any means of rescue. He tied the scroll to a stone with the cord of his
hunting-horn, and threw it down into the depth. But no sound came in
answer.</p>
<p>In the meantime all were straining to find a way of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=
"pb320">320</a>]</span>escape. Even the old Archduke Sigismund who,
though he is never accused of any knowledge of the alleged plot of his
courtiers, yet may well be supposed to have entertained no very good
feeling towards Maximilian, now forgot all ill-will, and despatched
swift messengers to Schwatz to summon the cleverest <i lang=
"de">Knappen</i> to come with their gear and see if they could not
devise a means for reaching him with a rope; others ran from village to
village, calling on all for aid and counsel. Some rang the storm-bells,
and some lighted alarm fires; while many more poured into the churches
and sanctuaries to pray for help from on High; and pious brotherhoods,
thousands in number, marching with their holy emblems veiled in
mourning, and singing dirges as they came, gathered round the base of
the Martinswand.</p>
<p>The Kaiser from his giddy height could make out something of what
was going on, but as no answer came, a second and a third time he
wrote, asking the same words. And when still no answer came&mdash;I am
following Collin&rsquo;s imaginative ballad&mdash;his heart sank down
within him and he said, &lsquo;If there were any hope, most surely my
people would have sent a shout up to me. So there is no doubt but that
I must die here.&rsquo; Then he turned his heart to God, and tried to
forget everything of this earth, and think only of that which is
eternal. But now the sun sank low towards the horizon. While light yet
remained, once more he took his tablet and wrote; he had no cord left
to attach it to the stone, so he bound it with his gold chain&mdash;of
what use were earthly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href=
"#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>ornaments any more to
him?&mdash;&lsquo;and threw it down,&rsquo; as the ballad forcibly
says, &lsquo;into the living world, out of that grave high placed in
air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One in the crowd caught it, and the people wept aloud as he read out
to them what the Kaiser had traced with failing hand. He thanked Tirol
for its loyal interest in his fate; he acknowledged humbly that his
suffering was a penance sent him worthily by heaven for the pride and
haughtiness with which he had pursued the chase, thinking nothing too
difficult for him. Now he was brought low. He offered his blood and his
life in satisfaction. He saw there was no help to be hoped for his
body; he trusted his soul to the mercy of God. But he besought them to
send to Zirl, and beg the priest there to bring the Most Holy Sacrament
and bless his last hour with Its Presence. When It arrived they were to
announce it to him by firing off a gun, and another while the
Benediction was imparted. Then he bid them all pray for steadfastness
for him, while the pangs of hunger gnawed away his life.</p>
<p>The priest of Zirl hastened to obey the summons, and the
Kaiser&rsquo;s injunctions were punctually obeyed. Meantime, the miners
of Schwatz were busy arranging their plan of operations&mdash;no easy
matter, for they stood fifteen hundred feet above the Emperor&rsquo;s
ledge. But before they were ready for the forlorn attempt, another
deliverer appeared upon the scene with a strong arm, supported the
almost lifeless form of the Emperor&mdash;for he had now been fifty-two
hours in this sad plight&mdash;and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322"
href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>bore him triumphantly up the
pathless height. There he restored him to the people, who, frantic with
joy, let him pass through their midst without observing his appearance.
Who was this deliverer? The traditions of the time say he was an angel,
sent in answer to the Kaiser&rsquo;s penitential trust in God and the
prayers of the people. Later narrators say&mdash;some, that he was a
bold huntsman; others, a reckless outlaw to whom the track was known,
and these tell you there is a record of a pension being paid annually
in reward for the service, if not to him, at least to some one who
claimed to have rendered it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5378src" href=
"#xd21e5378" name="xd21e5378src">5</a></p>
<p>The Monstrance, which bore the Blessed Sacrament from Zirl to carry
comfort to the Emperor in his dire need, was laid up among the
treasures of Ambras.</p>
<p>Maximilian, in thanksgiving for his deliverance, resolved to be less
reckless in his future expeditions, and never failed to remember the
anniversary. He also employed miners from Schwatz to cut a path down to
the hole, afterwards called the Max-H&ouml;hle, which had sheltered
him, to spare risk to his faithful subjects, who <i>would</i> make the
perilous descent to return thanks on the spot for his recovery; and he
set up there a crucifix, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href=
"#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>with figures of the Blessed Virgin
and S. John on either side large enough to be seen from below; and even
to the present day men used to dangerous climbing visit it with similar
sentiments. It is not often the tourist is tempted to make the attempt,
and they must be cool-headed who would venture it. The best view of it
is to be got from the remains of the little hunting-seat and church
which Maximilian afterwards built on the Martinsb&uuml;hl, a green
height opposite it, and itself no light ascent. It is said Maximilian
sometimes shot the chamois out of the windows of this villa. The
stories are endless of his hardihood and presence of mind in his alpine
expeditions. At one time, threatened by the descent of a falling rock,
he not only was alert enough to spring out of the way in time, but also
seized a huntsman following him, who was not so fortunate, and saved
him from being carried over the precipice. At another he saw a branch
of a tree overhanging a yawning abyss; to try his presence of mind he
swung himself on to it, and hung over the precipice; but crack! went
the branch, and yet he saved himself by an agile spring on to another
tree. Another time, when threatened by a falling rock, his presence of
mind showed itself in remaining quite still close against the mountain
wall, in the very line of its course, having measured with his eye that
there was space enough for it to clear him. But enough for the
present.</p>
<p>Zirl affords a good inn and a timely resting-place, either before
returning to Innsbruck, or starting afresh <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>to
visit the Isarthal and Scharnitz. The ascent of the Gross Solstein is
made from Zirl, as may also be that of the Martinswand. In itself Zirl
has not much to arrest attention, except its picturesque situation
(particularly that of its &lsquo;Calvarienberg,&rsquo; to form which
the living rocks are adapted), and its history, connecting it with the
defence of the country against various attacks from Bavaria. Proceeding
northwards along the road to Seefeld, and a little off it, you come
upon Fragenstein, another of Maximilian&rsquo;s hunting-seats, a strong
fortress for some two hundred years before his time, and now a fine
ruin. There are many strange tales of a great treasure buried here, and
a green-clad huntsman, who appears from time to time, and challenges
the peasants to come and help him dig it out, but something always
occurs to prevent the successful issue of the adventure. Once a party
of excavators got so far that they saw the metal vessel enclosing it;
but then suddenly arose such a frightful storm, that none durst proceed
with the work; and after that the clue to its place of concealment was
lost. Continuing the somewhat steep ascent, Leiten is passed, and then
Reit, with nothing to arrest notice; and then Seefeld, celebrated by
the legend my old friend told me on the Freundsberg.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5397src" href="#xd21e5397" name="xd21e5397src">6</a> The
Archduke Ferdinand built a special chapel to the left of the parish
church, called <i lang="de">die Heilige Blutskapelle</i>, in 1575, to
contain the Host which had convicted Oswald Milser, and which is even
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>now an object of frequent pilgrimage. The
altar-piece was restored last year very faithfully, and with
<span class="corr" id="xd21e5405" title=
"Source: conderable">considerable</span> artistic feeling, by
Haselwandter, of Botzen. It is adorned with statues of the favourite
heroes of the Tirolese legendary world, St. Sigismund and St. Oswald,
and compartment bas-reliefs of subjects of Gospel history known as
&lsquo;the Mysteries of the Rosary.&rsquo; The tone of the old work has
been so well caught, that it requires some close inspection to
distinguish the original remains from the new additions. The
Archduchess Eleonora provided the crystal reliquary and crown, and the
rich curtains within which it is preserved. At a little distance to
south-west of Seefeld, on a mountain-path leading to Telfs, is a little
circular chapel, built by Leopold V. in 1628, over a crucifix which had
long been honoured there. It is sometimes called the Kreuz-kapelle, but
more often the <i lang="de">zur-Seekapelle</i>, though one of the two
little lakes, whence the appellation, and the name of Seefeld too, was
derived, dried out in 1807. There is also a legend of the site having
been originally pointed out by a flight of birds similar to that I have
given concerning S. Georgenberg.</p>
<p>The road then falls more gently than on the Zirl side, but is rugged
and wild in its surroundings, to Scharnitz, near which you meet the
blue-green gushing waters of the Isar. Scharnitz has borne the brunt of
many a terrible contest in the character of outpost of Tirolean
defences: it is known to have been a fortress <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>in
the time of the Romans. It was one of the points strengthened by
Klaudia de&rsquo; Medici, who built the &lsquo;Porta Klaudia&rsquo; to
command the pass. Good service it did on more than one occasion; but it
succumbed in the inroad of French and Bavarians combined, in 1805. It
was garrisoned at that time by a small company of regular troops, under
an English officer in the Austrian service named Swinburne, whose
gallant resistance was cordially celebrated by the people. He was
overwhelmed, however, by superior numbers and appliances, and at
Marshal Ney&rsquo;s orders the fort was so completely destroyed, that
scarcely a trace of it is now to be found.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5417src" href="#xd21e5417" name="xd21e5417src">7</a> <span class=

<p>It is the border town against Bavaria, and is consequently enlivened
by a customs office and a few uniforms, but it is a poor place. I was
surprised to be accosted and asked for alms by a decent-looking woman,
whom I had seen kneeling in the church shortly before as this sort of
thing is not common in Tirol. She told me the place had suffered sadly
by the railway; for before, it was the post-station for all the traffic
between Munich and Innsbruck and Italy. The industries of the place
were not many or lucrative; the surrounding forests supply some
employment to woodmen; and what she called <i lang=
"de">Dirsten&ouml;hl</i>, which seems to be dialectic for <i lang=
"de"><span class="corr" id="xd21e5456" title=
"Source: Steinh&ouml;l">Stein&ouml;hl</span></i> or petroleum, is
obtained from the bituminous soil in the neighbourhood; it is obtained
by a kind of distillation&mdash;a laborious process. The work lasted
from S. Vitus&rsquo; Day to the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin; that
was now past, and her husband, who was employed in it, had nothing to
do; she had an old father to support, and a sick child. Then she went
on to speak of the devotion she had just been reciting in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span>the
church to obtain help, and evidently looked upon her meeting with me as
an answer to it. It seemed to consist in saying three times, a petition
which I wrote down at her dictation as
follows:&mdash;&lsquo;<span lang="de">Gott gr&uuml;sse dich Maria! ich
gr&uuml;sse dich drei und dreizig <span class="corr" id="xd21e5463"
title="Source: Tausand">Tausend</span> Mal; O Maria ich gr&uuml;sse
dich wie der Erzengel Gabriel dich greg&uuml;sset hat. Es erfreuet dich
in deinen Herzen dass der Erzengel Gabriel den himmlischen Gruss zu dir
gebracht hat. Ave Maria, &amp;c.</span>&rsquo; She said she had never
used that devotion and failed to obtain her request. I learnt that the
origin she ascribed to it was this:&mdash;A poor girl, a cow-herd of
Dorf, some miles over the Bavarian frontier, who was very devout to the
Blessed Virgin, had been in the habit while tending her herds of saying
the rosary three times every day in a little Madonna chapel near her
grazing-ground. But one summer there came a great heat, which burnt up
all the grass, and the cattle wandered hither and thither seeking their
scanty food, so that it was all she could do to run after and keep
watch over them. The good girl was now much distressed in mind; for the
tenour of her life had been so even before, that when she made her vow
to say the three rosaries, it had never occurred to her such a
contingency might happen. But she knew also that neither must she
neglect her supervision of the cattle committed to her charge. While
praying then to Heaven for light to direct her in this difficulty, the
simple girl thought she saw a vision of our Lady, bidding her be of
good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>heart, and she would teach her a prayer to say
instead, which would not take as long as the rosary, and would please
her as well, and that she should teach it also to others who might be
overwhelmed with work like herself. This was the petition I have quoted
above. But the maid was too humble to speak of having received so great
a favour, and lived and died without saying anything about it. When she
came to die, however, her soul could find no rest, for her commission
was unfulfilled; and whenever anyone passed alone by the wayside chapel
where she had been wont to pray, he was sure to see her kneeling there.
At last a pious neighbour, who knew how good she had been, summoned
courage to ask her how it was that she was dealt with thus. Then the
good girl told him what had befallen her long ago on that spot, and bid
him fulfil the part she had neglected, adding, &lsquo;But tell them
also not to think the mere saying the words is enough; they must pray
with faith and dependence on God, and also strive to keep themselves
from sin.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In returning from Zirl to Innsbruck, the left bank may be visited by
taking the Zirl bridge and pursuing the road bordering the river; you
come thus to Unterperfuss, another bourne of frequent excursion from
Innsbruck, the inn there having the reputation of possessing a good
cellar, and the views over the neighbourhood being most romantic, the
<i lang="fr">Ch&acirc;teau</i> of Ferklehen giving interest to the
natural beauties around. Hence, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330"
href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>instead of pursuing the
return journey at once, a digression may be made through the
Selrainthal (Selrain, in the dialect of the neighbourhood, means the
edge of a mountain); and it is indeed but a narrow strip bordering the
stream&mdash;the Melach or Malk, so called from its milk-white
waters&mdash;which pours itself out by three mouths into the Inn at the
debouchure of the valley. There is many a &lsquo;cluster of
houses,&rsquo; as German expresses<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5479src"
href="#xd21e5479" name="xd21e5479src">8</a> a settlement too small to
be dignified with the name of village, perched on the heights around,
but all reached by somewhat rugged paths. The first and prettiest is
Selrain, which is always locally called Rothenbrunn, because the iron
in the waters, which form an attraction to valetudinarian visitors, has
covered the soil over which they flow with a red deposit. Small as it
is, it boasts two churches, that to S. Quirinus being one of the most
ancient in Tirol. The mountain path through the Fatscherthal, though
much sought by Innsbruckers, is too rough travelling for the ordinary
tourist, but affords a fine mountain view, including the magnificent
<i lang="de">Fernerwand</i>, or glacier-wall, which closes it in, and
the three shining and beautifully graduated peaks of the Hohe
Villerspitz. At a short distance from Selrain may be found a pretty
cascade, one of the six falls of the Saigesbach. Some four or five
miles further along the valley is one of the numerous villages named
Gries; and about five miles more of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb331" href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>mountain footpath
leads to the coquettishly perched sanctuary of St. Sigismund, the
highest inhabited point of the Selrainthal. It is one of the many
high-peaked buildings with which the Archduke Sigismund, who seems to
have had a wonderful eye for the picturesque, loved to set off the
heaven-pointing cones of the Tirolese mountains. Another opening in the
mountains, which runs out from Gries, is the Lisenthal, in the midst of
which lie Juvenau and Neur&auml;tz, the latter much visited by parties
going to pick up the pretty crystal spar called
&lsquo;Andalusiten.&rsquo; Further along the path stands by the wayside
a striking fountain, set up for the refreshment of the weary, called
the Magdalenenbr&uuml;ndl, because adorned with a statue of the
Magdalen, the image of whose penitence was thought appropriate to this
stern solitude by the pious founder. The Melach is shortly after
crossed by a rustic bridge, and a path over wooded hills leads to the
ancient village of Pragmar. Hence the ascent of the Sonnenberg or
Lisens-Ferner is made. The monastery of Wilten has a summer villa on
its lower slope, serving as a dairy for the produce of their pastures
in the neighbourhood; a hospitable place of refreshment for the
traveller and alpine climber, and with its chapel constituting a
grateful object both to the pilgrim and the artist. The less robust and
enterprising will find an easier excursion in the Lengenthal, a
romantically wild valley, which forms a communication between the
Lisenthal and the &OElig;tzthal. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332"
href="#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Selrainthalers are behind none in maintaining the national
character. When the law of conscription&mdash;one of the most obnoxious
results of the brief cession to Bavaria&mdash;was propounded, the
youths of the Selrain were the first to show that, though ever ready to
devote their lives to the defence of the fatherland, they would never
be enrolled in an army in whose ranks they might be sent to fight in
they knew not what cause&mdash;perhaps against their own brethren. The
generous stand they made against the measure constituted their valley
the rendezvous of all who would escape from it for miles round, and
soon their band numbered some five hundred. During the whole of the
Bavarian occupation they maintained their independence, and were among
the first to raise the standard of the year 1809. A strong force was
sent out on March 14 to reduce them to obedience, when the Selrainers
gave good proof that it was not cowardice which had made them refuse to
join the army. They repulsed the Bavarian regulars with such signal
success, that the men of the neighbourhood were proud to range
themselves under their banner, which as long as the campaign lasted was
always found in the thickest of the fight. No less than eleven of their
number received decorations for personal bravery. In peace, too, they
have shown they know how to value the independence for which they
fought; though their labours in the field are so greatly enhanced by
the steepness of the ground which is their portion, that the men yoke
themselves to the plough, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href=
"#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>and carry burdens over places
where no oxen could be guided. Their industry and perseverance provide
them so well with enough to make them contented, if not prosperous,
that &lsquo;<i lang="de">in Selrain hat jeder zu arbeiten und zu
essen</i>&rsquo; (in Selrain there is work and meat enough for all) is
a common proverb. The women, who are unable for the reason above noted
to take so much part in field-labours as in some other parts, have
found an industry for themselves in bleaching linen, and enliven the
landscape by the cheerful zest with which they ply their thrifty
toil.</p>
<p>The path for the return journey from Selrain to
Ober-Perfuss&mdash;or foot of the upper height&mdash;is as rugged as
the other paths we have been traversing, but is even more picturesque.
The church is newly restored, and contains a monument, with
high-sounding Latin epitaph, to one Peter Anich, of whose labours in
overcoming the difficulties of the survey and mensuration of his
country, which has nowhere three square miles of plain, his
co-villagers are justly proud. He was an entirely self-taught man, but
most accurate in his observations, and he induced other peasants to
emulate his studies. Ober-perfuss also has a mineral spring. A pleasant
path over hills and fields leads in about an hour to Kematen, a very
similar village; but the remains of the ruined hunting-seat of
Pirschenheim, now used as an ordinary lodging-house, adds to its
picturesqueness. Near by it may also be visited the pretty waterfall of
the Sendersbach. A shorter and easier <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb334" href="#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span>stage is the next,
through the fields to V&ouml;ls or Vels, which clusters at the foot of
the Blasienberg, once the dwelling of a hermit, and still a place of
pilgrimage and the residence of the priest of the village. The parish
church of Vels is dedicated in honour of S. Jodok, the English saint,
whose statue we saw keeping watch over Maximilian&rsquo;s tomb at
Innsbruck. Another hour across the level ground of the Galwiese,
luxuriantly covered with Indian corn, brings us back to Innsbruck
through the Innrain; the Galwiese has its name from the echo of the
hills, which close in the plain as it nears the capital; wiese being a
meadow, and <i lang="de">gal</i> the same form of <i lang=
"de">Schall</i>&mdash;resonance, which occurs in <i lang=
"de">Nachtigall</i>, nightingale; and also, strangely enough, in
<i lang="de">gellen</i>, to sound loudly (or yell). At the cross-road
(to Axams) we passed some twenty minutes out of V&ouml;ls, where the
way is still wild, is the so-called <i lang="de">Schwarze
Kreuz-kapelle</i>. One Blasius H&ouml;lzl, ranger of the neighbouring
forest, was once overtaken by a terrible storm; the Geroldsbach,
rushing down from the G&ouml;tzneralp, had obliterated the path with
its torrents; the reflection of each lightning flash in the waste of
waters around seemed like a sword pointed at the breast of his horse,
who shied and reared, and threatened to plunge his rider in the
ungoverned flood. H&ouml;lzl was a bold forester, but he had never
known a night like this; and as the rapidly succeeding flashes almost
drove him to distraction, he vowed to record the deliverance on the
spot by a cross of iron, of equal weight to himself <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>and
his mount, if he reached his fireside in safety. Then suddenly the
noisy wind subsided, the clouds owned themselves spent, and in place of
the angry forks of flame only soft and friendly sheets of light played
over the country, and enabled him to steer his homeward way. H&ouml;lzl
kept his promise, and a black metal cross of the full weight promised
long marked the spot, and gave it its present name.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5519src" href="#xd21e5519" name="xd21e5519src">9</a> The
accompanying figures of our Lady and S. John having subsequently been
thrown down, it was removed to the chapel on Blasienberg. Ferneck, a
pleasant though primitive bath establishment, is prettily situated on
the Innsbruck side of the Galwiese, and the church there was also once
a favourite sanctuary with the people; but when the neighbouring land
was taken from the monks at Wilten, who had had it ever since the days
of the penitent giant Haymon, it ceased to be remembered.</p>
<p>Starting from Innsbruck again in a southerly direction, a little
beyond Wilten, already described, we <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>reach Berg Isel.
Though invaded in part by the railway, it is still a worthy bourne of
pilgrimage, by reason of the heroic victories of the patriots under
Hofer. On Sunday and holiday afternoons parties of Innsbruckers may
always be found refreshing these memories of their traditional prowess.
It is also precious on less <span class="corr" id="xd21e5545" title=
"Source: fre-frequented">frequented</span> occasions for the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e5548" title=
"Source: splended">splendid</span> view it affords of the whole
Innthal. Two columns in the <i lang="de">Scheisstand</i> record the
honours of April 29 and August 30, 1809, with the inscription,
&lsquo;<i lang="la">Donec erunt montes et saxa et pectora nostra
Austriac&aelig; domini m&aelig;nia semper erunt</i>.&rsquo; I must
confess, however, that the noise of the perpetual rifle-practice is a
great vexation, and prevents one from preserving an unruffled memory of
the patriotism of which it is the exponent; but this holds good all
over Germany. Here, on May 29, fell Graf Johan v. Stachelburg, the last
of his noble family, a martyr to his country&rsquo;s cause. The
peasants among whom he was fighting begged him not to expose his life
so recklessly, but he would not listen. &lsquo;I shall die but
once,&rsquo; he replied to all their warnings; &lsquo;and where could
it befall me better than when fighting for the cause of God and
Austria?&rsquo; He was mortally wounded, and carried in a litter
improvised from the brushwood to Mutters, where he lies buried. A
little beyond the southern incline of Berg Isel a path strikes out to
the right, and ascends the heights to the two villages of Natters and
Mutters, the people of which were only in 1786 released from the
obligation of going to Wilten for their Mass of obligation.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>Natters has some remains of one of Archduke
Sigismund&rsquo;s high-perched hunting-seats, named Waidburg; he also
instituted in 1446 a foundation for saying five Masses weekly in its
chapel.</p>
<p>There are further several picturesque mountain walks to be found in
the neighbourhood of Innsbruck, under the grandly towering Nockspitze
and the Patscherkofl. Or again from either Mutters or Natters there is
a path leading down to G&ouml;tzens, Birgitz, Axams, and Grintzens,
across westwards to the southern end of the Selrainthal. G&ouml;tzens
(from <i lang="de">G&ouml;tze</i>, an idol), like the Hundskapelle,
received its name for having retained its heathen worship longer than
the rest of the district around. The ruins, which you see on a detached
peak as you leave G&ouml;tzens again, are the two towers of
Liebenberger, and V&ouml;llenberger the poor remains of Schloss
V&ouml;llenberg, the seat of an ancient Tirolean family of that name,
who were very powerful in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It fell
in to the Crown during the reign of Friedrich <i lang="de">mit der
leeren Tasche</i>, by the death of its last male heir. Frederick
converted it into a state-prison. The noblest person it ever harboured
was the poet Oswald von Wolkenstein. Himself a knight of noble lineage,
he had been inclined in the early part of Frederick&rsquo;s reign to
join his influence with the rest of the nobility against him, because
he took alarm at his <span class="corr" id="xd21e5568" title=
"Source: familarity">familiarity</span> with the common people.
Frederick&rsquo;s sudden establishment of his power, and the energetic
proceedings he immediately adopted for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb338" href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>consolidating it,
took many by surprise, Oswald von Wolkenstein among the rest. He was a
bard of too sweet song, however, to be shut up in a cage, and Friedl
was not the man to keep the minstrel in durance when it was safe to let
him be at large. He had no sooner established himself firmly on the
throne than he not only released the poet, but forgetting all cause of
animosity against him, placed him at his court, and delighted his
leisure hours with listening to his warbling. Oswald&rsquo;s wild and
adventurous career had stored his mind with such subjects as Friedl
would love to hear sung. But we shall have more to say of Oswald when
we come to his home in the Gr&ouml;dnerthal.</p>
<p>The next village is Birgitz; and the next, after crossing the
torrent which rushes down from the Alpe Lizum, is Axams, one of the
most ancient in the <span class="corr" id="xd21e5575" title=
"Source: neigbourhood">neighbourhood</span>, after passing the opening
to the lonesome but richly pastured Sendersthal, the slopes of which
meet those of the Selrainthal.</p>
<p>The only remaining valley of North Tirol which I have room here to
treat is the Stubay Thal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5580src" href=
"#xd21e5580" name="xd21e5580src">10</a> Of the three or four ways
leading into it from Innsbruck, all rugged, the most remarkable is
called by the people &lsquo;<span lang="de">beim Papstl</span>&rsquo;
because that traversed by Pius VI. when he passed through Tirol, as I
have already narrated. The first place of any interest is Waldrast, a
pilgrim&rsquo;s chapel, dating from the year 1465. A poor peasant was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>directed by a voice he heard in his sleep to go
to the woods (<i lang="de">Wald</i>), and lay him down to rest
(<i lang="de">Rast</i>), and it would be told him what he should do;
hence the name of the spot. There the Madonna appeared to him, and bid
him build a chapel over an image of her which appeared there, no one
knew how, some years before.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5595src" href=
"#xd21e5595" name="xd21e5595src">11</a> A Servite monastery, built in
1624 on the spot, is now in ruins, but the pilgrimage is still often
made. It may be reached from the railway station of Matrey. The ascent
of the Serlesspitz being generally undertaken from here, it is called
in Innsbruck the Waldrasterspitz. Fulpmes is the largest village of the
Stubay Thal. The inhabitants are all workers in iron and steel
implements, and among other things are reckoned to make the best spikes
for the shoes of the mountain climbers. Their works are carried all
over Austria and Italy, but less now than formerly. In the church are
some pictures by a peasant girl of this place. Few will be inclined to
pursue this valley further; and the only remaining place of any mark is
Neustift, the marshy ground round which provides the Innsbruck market
with frogs. The church of Neustift was built, at considerable cost, in
the tasteless style of the last century. The wood carvings by the
Tirolean artists Keller, Hatter, and Zatter, however, are meritorious.

Primisser, who took great pains to collect all the various traditions
of this event, mentions a favourite huntsman of the Emperor, named
Oswald Zips, whom he ennobled as Hallaurer v. Hohenfelsen. This may
have been the actual deliverer, or may have been supposed to be such,
from the circumstance of the title being Hohenfelsen, or Highcliff; and
that a patent of nobility was bestowed on a huntsman would imply that
he had rendered <i>some</i> singular service: the family, however, soon
died out.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I think it
possible that R. H. B. (to whom we owe the very interesting
<i>Traditions of Tirol</i>), and perhaps others of your readers, may
care to hear some of the particulars, as they are treasured by his
family, of the defence of Scharnitz by Baron Swinburne. R. H. B. speaks
of it in your number of last month. That defence was so gallant as to
call forth the respect and admiration even of his enemies, and Baron
Swinburne was given permission to name his own terms of surrender.</p>
<p class="footnote">He requested for himself, and those under him, that
they might be allowed to retain their swords. This was granted, and the
prisoners were sent to Aix-la-Chapelle, where everyone was asking in
astonishment who were &lsquo;<span lang="fr">les prisonniers avec
l&rsquo;&eacute;p&eacute;e a c&ocirc;t&eacute;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">The Eagles of Austria, that had been so nobly
defended by the Englishman and his little band, never fell into the
hands of the French. One of the Tirolese escaped, with the colours
wrapped round his body under his clothes, and though he was hunted
among the mountains for months, he was never taken; and some years
after he came to his commander in Vienna and gave him the colours he
had so bravely defended. They are now in possession of Baron Edward
Swinburne, the son of the defender of Scharnitz, who himself won,
before he was eighteen, the Order of &lsquo;the Iron Crown,&rsquo; by
an act that well deserves to be called &lsquo;a golden deed;&rsquo; and
ere he was twenty he had led his first and last forlorn hope, when he
received so severe a wound as to cost him his leg, which has
incapacitated him for further service.</p>
<p class="footnote">His father received the highest military decoration
of Austria, that of &lsquo;Maria Teresa;&rsquo; he fought at Austerlitz
and Wagram; on the latter occasion he was severely wounded. Later in
life, he was for many years Governor of Milan.</p>

offering to a temple or Buddhist college a gift of silver or even gold

<p class="first">It is time that we turn our attention to the
Traditions of South and W&auml;lsch-Tirol, though it must not be
supposed that we have by any means exhausted those of the North. There
are so many indications that ere long the rule over the province, or
<i lang="de">Kreis</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5626src" href=
"#xd21e5626" name="xd21e5626src">1</a> as it is called, of
W&auml;lsch-Tirol, may some day be transferred to Italy, that,
especially as our present view of it is somewhat retrospective, it is
as well to consider it first, and before its homogeneity with the rest
of the principality is destroyed.</p>
<p>W&auml;lsch, or Italian-Tirol sometimes, especially of late,
denominated the Trentino, comprises the sunniest, and some at least, of
the most beautiful valleys of Tirol. The Etschthal, or valley of the
Adige, which takes its source from the little lake Reschen, also
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=

colour of its waters, near Nauders, traverses both South and
W&auml;lsch-Tirol. That part of the Etschthal belonging to the latter
<i lang="de">Kreis</i> takes a direct north to south direction down its
centre. There branch out from it two main lines of valleys on the west,
and two on the east. The northernmost line on the west side is formed
of the Val di Non and the Val di Sole; on the east, of the Avisio
valley under its various changes of name which will be noted in their
place. The Southern line on the west is called Giudicaria, and on the
east, Val Sugana, or valley of the Euganieren.</p>

<p>The traveller&rsquo;s first acquaintance with the <i lang=

case, be made in the Val Lagarina, through which the railway of Upper
Italy passes insensibly on to Tirolese soil, for you are allowed to get
as far as Ala before the custom-house visitation reminds you that you
have passed inside another government. It is a wild gorge along which
you run, only less formidable than that which you saw so grimly close
round you as you left Verona. If you could but lift that stony veil on
your left, you would see the beautiful Garda-See sparkling beside you;
but how vexatious soever the denial, the envious mountains interpose
their stern steeps to conceal it. Their recesses conceal too, but to
our less regret, the famous field of Rivoli.</p>
<p>Borghetto is the first village on Tirolese soil, and Ala, in the
Middle Ages called Sala, the first town. It <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>thrives on the production of silk, introduced
here from Lombardy about 1530. It has a picturesque situation, and some
buildings that claim a place in the sketchbook. The other places of
interest in the neighbourhood are most conveniently visited from
Roveredo, or Rofreit as the Germans call it, a less important and
pleasing town than Trent, but placed in a prettier neighbourhood. It
received its name of Roboretum from the Latins, on account of the
immense forests of oak with which it was surrounded in their time. The
road leading through it, being the highway into the country, bristles
all along its way with ancient strongholds, as Avio, Predajo, Lizzana,
Castelbarco, Beseno, and others, which have all had their share in the
numerous struggles for ascendancy, waged for so many years between the
Emperor, the Republic of Venice, the Bishops of Trent, and the powerful
families inhabiting them. The last-named preserves a tradition of more
peaceful interest. At the time that Dante was banished from Florence,
Lizzana was a seat of the Scaligers, and they had him for their visitor
for some time during his wanderings. Not far from it is the so-called
Slavini di San Marco, a vast <i lang="de">Steinmeer</i>, which seems,
as it were, a ruined mountain, such vast blocks of rock lie scattered
on every side. There is little doubt the poet has immortalized the
scene he had the opportunity of contemplating here in his description
of the descent to the Inferno, opening of Canto XII. It is said that a
fine city, called San <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href=
"#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span>Marco, lies buried under these
gigantic fragments, concerning which the country people were very
curious, and were continually excavating to arrive at the treasure it
was supposed to contain, till one day a peasant thus engaged saw
written in fiery letters on one vast boulder, &lsquo;<i lang="it">Beati
quelli che mi volteranno</i>&rsquo; (happy they who turn me round). The
peasant thought his fortune was made. There could be no doubt the
promised happiness must consist in the riches which<a id="xd21e5661"
name="xd21e5661"></a> turning over the stone should disclose. Plenty of
neighbours were ready to lend a hand to so promising a toil; and after
the most unheard-of exertions, the monster stone was upheaved. But
instead of a treasure they found nothing but another inscription, which
said &lsquo;<i lang="it">Bene mi facesti, perch&egrave; le coscie mi
duolevano</i> (you have done me a good turn, for I had a pain in my
<span class="corr" id="xd21e5667" title=
"Source: ribs">thighs</span>).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5670src"
href="#xd21e5670" name="xd21e5670src">2</a> As the peasants felt no
great satisfaction in working with no better pay than this, the buried
city of San Marco ceased from this time to be the object of their
search. Nevertheless, near Mori, on the opposite (west) side of the
river, is a deep cave called &lsquo;<span lang="it">la Busa del
Barbaz</span>,&rsquo; concerning which the saying runs, that it was,
ages ago, the lurking-place of a cruel white-bearded old man, who lived
on human flesh, and that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href=
"#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>whoso has the courage to explore
the cave and discover his remains, will, immediately on touching them,
be confronted by his spirit, who will tell the adventurous wight where
an immense treasure lies hid. Some sort of origin for this fable may be
found in an older tradition, which tells that idols, whose rites
demanded human sacrifices, were cast down this cave by the first
Christian converts of the Lenothal. The Slavini are closed by a rocky
gorge, characteristically named Serravalle; and as the country again
opens out another cave on the east bank is pointed out, which was for
long years a resort of robbers, who plundered all who passed that way.
These were routed out by the Prince-bishop of Trent in 1197, and a
hospice for the relief of travellers built on the very spot which so
long had been the terror of the wayfarer. The chapel was dedicated in
honour of S. Margaret, and still retains the name.</p>
<p>Roveredo itself is crowned by a fort&mdash;Schloss Junk, or Castel
nuovo&mdash;which has stood many a siege, originally built by the
Venetians; but it is more distinguished by its villas and
manufactories. The silk trade was introduced here in 1580, and has
continuously added to the prosperity of the place. Gaetano Tacchi
established relations with England at the end of the last century, and
the four brothers of the same name, who now represent her house, are
the richest family in Roveredo. They have a very pretty family vault
near the Madonna del Monte, a pilgrimage reached by a road which starts
behind the <i lang="de">Pfarrkirche</i> of Sta. Maria. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>Another pilgrimage church newly established is
the Madonna de Saletto. While the silk factories occupy the Italian
hands, the Germans resident in Roveredo find employment at a
newly-established tobacco factory. Much tobacco is grown in the
Trentino.</p>
<p>A great deal of activity is seen in Roveredo. The <i lang="it">Corso
nuovo</i> is a broad handsome street with fine trees. A new and
handsome road, between the town and railway station, was laid out in
the autumn of 1869. Outside the town is the so-called Lenoschlucht,
reached by the <i lang="it">Strada nuova</i>, which crosses it by a
daring high arched bridge. The cliff rises sheer on the right hand, and
overlooking the dangerous precipice is the little chapel of S.
Columban, seemingly perched there by enchantment. It is built over the
spot where a hermit, who was held in veneration by the neighbourhood,
had his retreat.</p>
<p>There are seven churches, but not much to remark in any of them.
That of S. Rocchus was built in consequence of a vow made by the
townspeople during the plague of 1630, to invite a settlement of
Franciscans if it was stayed. The altar-piece is ascribed to Giovanni
da Udine. There are several educational establishments, and a club
which is devoted to propagandism of Italian tendencies.</p>
<p>The time to see Trent to advantage is in the month of June, not only
for the sake of the natural beauties of climate and scenery, but
because then falls the festa of S. Vigilius (26th), the evangelizer of
the country, and the churches are crowded with all the surrounding
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>mountain population, who, after religious
observances have been duly fulfilled, indulge in all their
characteristic games and amusements, often in representations of sacred
dramas,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5700src" href="#xd21e5700" name=
"xd21e5700src">3</a> and always wind up with their favourite and
peculiar illumination of their mountain sides by disposing bonfires in
devices over a whole slope. This custom is the more worth noting that
it is thought to be a remnant of fire-worship, prevailing before the
entrance of the Etruscans.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5703src" href=
"#xd21e5703" name="xd21e5703src">4</a></p>
<p>That their city was the see of S. Vigilius, and the seat of the
great council of the Church, are reckoned by its people their greatest
glories; and they delight to trace a parallel between their city and
&lsquo;great Rome.&rsquo; They reckon that it was founded in the time
of Tarquinius Priscus by a colony of Etruscans, under a leader
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347</a>]</span>named Rh&aelig;tius, who established there the
worship of Neptune, whence the name of Tridentum or Trent. That they
occupied and fortified the country, and subsequently became a power
formidable to the Empire; <span class="corr" id="xd21e5723" title=
"Source: But">but</span> some twenty-five years before the Christian
era, Rh&aelig;tia, as the country round was called, was conquered by
Drusus, son-in-law of Augustus, and colonized. An ancient inscription
preserved in the Schloss Buon Consiglio shows that Trent was the centre
of the local government, which was exactly modelled on that of Rome. S.
Vigilius, who spread the light of the faith here, was a born Roman, and
suffered martyrdom in a persecution emulating those of Rome in the year
400. The city endured sieges and over-running from many of the
barbarous nations which over-ran and sacked Rome, and researches into
the ancient foundations show that the accumulation of ruins has raised
the soil, as in Rome, some feet above the original ground
plan&mdash;Ranzi says more than four metres. The traces of three
distinct lines of walls, showing just as in Rome the progressive
enlargement of the city, have been found, as also remains of a
considerable amphitheatre, and many of inlaid pavements, &amp;c.,
showing that it was handsomely built and provided. To complete the
parallel, it was under the r&eacute;gime of an ecclesiastical ruler
that, after years of distress and turmoil, its peace and prosperity
were restored. The Bishop of Trent still retains his title of Prince,
but the deprivation of his territorial rule was one of the measures of
secularization of Joseph II. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href=
"#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are sixteen churches in Trent, of which the most considerable
is the Cathedral, dating from the eleventh century&mdash;with some
remnants of sculpture, as the Lombard ornaments of the three porches,
reckoned to belong to the seventh or eighth&mdash;a Romanesque building
of massive design, built of the reddish-brown marble which abounds in
the neighbourhood, with a Piazza and fountain before it. The interior
is extensively decorated with frescoes. It is dedicated to S. Vigilius,
whose relics are preserved in a silver sarcophagus. Among its other
notabilia are a Madonna, by Perugino, and some good paintings of less
esteemed masters; also a copy of the Madonna di San Luca of the
Pantheon, presented in 1465 to the then Bishop of Trent, while on a
visit to Rome, by the Pope, and ever since an object of popular
veneration. As a curiosity, is shown a waxen image of the Blessed
Virgin, modelled by a Jew. It also contains several curious brass
monuments. The Church of Sta. Maria Maggiore, where the great Council
was held, on this account, surpasses it in interest, though of small
architectural merit. There is a legend that when the final Te Deum at
the close of the Council was sung on December 4, 1563,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5729src" href="#xd21e5729" name="xd21e5729src">5</a>
a crucifix, still pointed out in one of the side chapels<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5735src" href="#xd21e5735" name="xd21e5735src">6</a>
of the Cathedral, was seen to bow <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349"
href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>its head as if in token of
approval of the constitutions that had been established. Sta. Maria
Maggiore contains a picture of the Council, with the fathers in full
session, which is not without interest, as all the costumes can still
be made out, though quaint and faded and injured by lightning. It has
also a very fine organ, the tone of which was so much esteemed at the
time it was built, that it is said the Town Council determined to put
out the eyes of the organ-builder,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5740src"
href="#xd21e5740" name="xd21e5740src">7</a> lest he should endow any
other city with as perfect an instrument. The meister, finding he could
not prevail on the councilmen to relent, asked as a last favour to be
allowed to play on his organ, which was willingly conceded; but as soon
as he had obtained access to the instrument, he contrived to damage the
stop imitating the human voice, which he had invented, and which had
been its great merit, and thus punished the pride and cruelty of the
municipality. In the remarkable Gothic Church of St. Peter is a chapel,
built in commemoration of the infant St. Simeon, or Simonin, whose
alleged martyrdom at the hands of the Jews, in 1472, I have already had
reason to mention. Many relics of him are shown in the chapel, where a
festa is still kept in his honour on March 24. The cutting of his name
in the stone is still quite legible. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb350" href="#pb350" name="pb350">350</a>]</span></p>
<p>My limits forbid my speaking in much detail of the secular buildings
and institutions which are, however, not unworthy of attention. There
are clubs and reading-rooms&mdash;in some of which aspirations after
union with Italy are steadily propagated. The spirit of loyalty to
Austria, though still strong in many breasts, has nothing like the same
influence as in 1848&ndash;9, or in 1866, when the attacks and
blandishments of the revolutionists of Italy were alike powerless to
shake the allegiance of the Trentiners. No one will overlook the vast
Schloss buon Consiglio in the Piazza d&rsquo;Armi, said to be an
Etruscan foundation. The public museum is a very creditable
institution, enriched in 1846 by the legacy of Count Giovanelli&rsquo;s
collection, chiefly of coins and medals; and paintings, not to be
despised, are to be seen in the collections of the best families of the
place&mdash;Palazzi Wolkenstein and Sizzo, Case Salvetti and Gaudenti.
Two great ornaments of the city are the Palazzi Tabarelli, and Zambelli
or <i lang="de">Teufelspalast</i>; and with the legend of the latter I
must wind up my notice of Trent.</p>
<p>Georg Fugger, a scion of the wealthy Anthony Fugger, of Augsburg,
the entertainer of Charles Quint, was deeply enamoured of the spirited
Claudia Porticelli, the <span class="corr" id="xd21e5751" title=
"Source: acknowleged">acknowledged</span> beauty of Trent. Claudia did
not appear at all averse from the match, but she was too proud to yield
herself all too readily; and besides, was genuinely possessed with the
spirit of patriotism, to which mountain folk are never wanting.
Accordingly, when the reply long <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351"
href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>pressed for from her lips
came at last, it informed him that never would Claudia Porticelli of
Tirolean Trent give her hand to one whose dwelling was afar from her
native city; she wondered, indeed, that one who did not own so much as
a little house to call a home in Trent, should imagine he possessed her
sympathies. To another this answer would have amounted to a refusal,
for it only wanted a day of the time already fixed, of long date
beforehand, for the announcement of her final choice. But Georg Fugger,
whose vast riches had long nursed him in the belief that
&lsquo;<i>money</i> maketh man,&rsquo; and that nothing was denied to
him, would not yield up a hope so dearly cherished as that of making
Claudia Porticelli his wife. To his determined mind there was a way of
doing everything a man was resolved to do. To build a house, however,
in one night, and that a house worthy of being the home of his Claudia,
when men should call her Claudia Fugger, was a serious matter indeed.
No human hands could do the work, that was clear; he must have recourse
to help from which a good Christian should shrink; but the case was
desperate; he had no choice. Nevertheless, Georg Fugger had no mind to
endanger his soul either. The game he had to play was to get the Evil
One to build the house, but also to guard from letting him gain any
spiritual advantage against him; and his indomitable energy devised the
means of securing the one and preventing the other. Without loss of
time the devil was summoned, and the task of building the desired
palace <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span>propounded. The tempter willingly accepted the
undertaking, on his usual condition of the surrender of the soul of him
in whose favour it was performed. Georg Fugger cheerfully signed the
bond with his blood, only stipulating first for the insertion of one
slight condition on his side&mdash;namely, that the devil should do one
little other thing for him before he claimed his terrible guerdon.
&lsquo;Whatever you like! it won&rsquo;t be too hard for me!&rsquo;
boasted the Evil One; and they separated, each well satisfied with the
compact.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Palace has a splendid design, worthy the
genius of Palladio,&rsquo; writes a modern traveller, who has only seen
it in its decadence. On the night in which it was built, it was
resplendent with marbles and gilding and tasteful decoration; furnished
it was too, to satisfy the most fastidious taste, and the requirements
of the most luxurious. With pride the devil called Georg Fugger to come
and survey the lordly edifice, and name his &lsquo;final
condition.&rsquo; Georg Fugger was prepared for him; he had taken a
bushel of corn, and strewn it over all the floors of the vast building.
&lsquo;Look here, Meister,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;If you can gather
this corn up grain by grain, and deliver me back the whole number
correctly, then indeed my soul will be yours; but if otherwise, my soul
remains my own and the palace too. That is my final
condition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The devil accepted <span class="corr" id="xd21e5765" title=
"Source: he">the</span> task readily, and with no misgiving of his
success. True, it took all the time that remained before sunrise to
collect all the scattered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href=
"#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>grain; still he had performed
harder feats before that day. But the hours ran by, and still there
were five grains wanting to complete the count; where could those five
grains be! With a flaring torch, lighted at his fiercest fire, he
searched every corner through and through, but the five grains were
nowhere to be seen, and daylight began to appear! &lsquo;Ah! the
measure is well-heaped up, the Fugger won&rsquo;t discover they are
missing,&rsquo; so the fiend flattered himself. But Georg Fugger was
keener than he seemed. Before his eyes he counted out the corn, and
asked for the five missing grains. &lsquo;Stuff! the measure is piled
up full enough, I can&rsquo;t be so particular as all that. The number
must be there.&rsquo; &lsquo;But it is not!&rsquo; urged Fugger.
&lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve miscounted,&rsquo; rejoined the Evil One;
<span class="corr" id="xd21e5770" title=
"Not in source">&lsquo;</span>I&rsquo;m not going to be put off in that
way. I&rsquo;ve built your house, and I&rsquo;ve collected your measure
of corn, and your soul is mine; you can&rsquo;t prove that there were
five more grains.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, I can,&rsquo; replied Fugger;
&lsquo;reach out me your paw;&rsquo; and the Devil, not guessing how he
could convict him by that means, held out his great paw, with insolent
confidence of manner. &lsquo;There!&rsquo; cried Fugger, pointing to it
as he spoke; &lsquo;there, under your own claws, lie the five grains!
That corn had been offered before the Holy Rood, and by the power of
the five Sacred Wounds it was kept from fulfilling your fell purpose.
You had not collected the full number of grains into the measure by the
morning light, so our bargain is at an end. Begone!&rsquo; The Devil,
self-convicted, had no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href=
"#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>refuge but to strive to alarm his
victor by a show of fury, and with burning claw he began tearing down
the wall so lately raised. But Fugger remained imperturbable, for he
had fairly won the palace, and the Devil himself had no more power over
it. He could only succeed in making a hole big enough for himself to
escape by, which hole was for many and many years pointed out.</p>
<p>But Fugger had also hereby established his claim to Claudia&rsquo;s
hand, who rejoiced at the gentle violence thus done her; and many happy
days they spent together in the <i lang="de">Teufelspalast</i>. In
later years it passed from their family into the hands of Field-Marshal
Gallas, who lived here in peaceful retirement after his renowned
exploits in the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, whence it was long called
Palazzo Gallas or Golassi; but it has lately again changed hands, and
thus acquired the name of Palazzo Zambelli.</p>
<p>The suburbs of Trent, among other excursions, offer the pleasing
pilgrimage of the <i lang="de">Madonna alle Laste</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5785src" href="#xd21e5785" name="xd21e5785src">8</a>
which is reached through the Porta dell&rsquo; Aquila, on the east side
of the city, by half an hour&rsquo;s climbing up a mountain path off
the road to Bassano. On a spur of this declivity had stood from time
immemorial a marble <i lang="de">Maria-Bild</i>, honoured by the
veneration of the people. Somewhere about the year 1630 a Jew wantonly
disfigured and damaged the sacred token, to the indignation of the
whole neighbourhood. Christopher Detscher, a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>German artist, devoted himself to restoring it;
but it was impossible altogether to obliterate the traces of the
injury. By some means or other, however&mdash;the people said by
miraculous intervention&mdash;it was altogether renewed in one night;
and this prodigy so enhanced its fame, that there was no case so
desperate but they believed it must obtain relief when pleaded for at
such a shrine. A poor cowherd named Antonia, who had been deaf all her
life, was said to have received the power of hearing after praying
there; and a child, who had died before there was time to baptise it, a
reprieve of existence long enough to receive that Sacrament. The
grateful people now immediately set themselves to raise a stone chapel
over it, and by their ready alms maintained a hermit on the spot to
guard the sacred precincts. Twelve years later, by the bounty of
Field-Marshal Gallas, a community of Carmelites was established on the
spot, which continued to flourish down to the secularization of Joseph
II. The convent buildings, however, yet serve the beneficent purpose of
a Refuge for foundlings and orphans. The prospect from the precincts of
the institution is very fine; between the distant ranges of mountains
and the foreground slopes covered with peach trees, lies the grand old
city of Trent, shaped, like the country of Tirol itself, in the form of
a heart.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5793src" href="#xd21e5793" name=
"xd21e5793src">9</a> Very effective in accentuating the outline
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>are the two old castles of the Buon&rsquo;
Consiglio and the Palazzo degli Alberi, both formerly
fortress-residences of the Prince-Bishops of Trent, the former vieing
with the castle of the Prince-Bishop of Salzburg in extent and
grandeur. The curious isolated rock of Dos Trento is another centre of
a splendid view. The Romans called it Verruca, a wart. It was strongly
fortified by Augustus, and remains of inscriptions and bas-reliefs are
built into the wall of the ancient church of St. Apollinaria, occupying
the site of a temple of Saturn. The vantage ground it afforded in
repelling the entry of the French in 1703 obtained for it the name of
the <i lang="de">Franzosenb&uuml;hel</i>. It has lately been newly
fortified. A charming but somewhat adventurous excursion may be made on
foot, by a path starting from the fort of the Dos Trento rock, to the
cascade of Sardagna. Somewhere about this path, in the neighbourhood of
Cadine, it is said, St. Ingenuin,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5802src"
href="#xd21e5802" name="xd21e5802src">10</a> one of the early
evangelizers of the country, planted a beautiful garden, which was a
living model of the Garden of Eden; but so divinely beautiful was it,
that to no mortal was it given to find it. Only the holy Albuin
obtained by his prayers permission once to find entrance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>to
&lsquo;St. Ingenuin&rsquo;s Garden.&rsquo; Entranced with the delights
of the place, he determined at least to bring back some sample of its
produce. So he gathered some of its golden fruits, to show the children
of earth. To this day a choice yellow apple, something like our golden
pippin, grown in the neighbourhood, goes by the name of St.
Albuin&rsquo;s apple.</p>
<p>The only remaining towns of any note in the line of the
W&auml;lschtirolische Etschthal, are Lavis and S. Michel. Lavis is a
pretty little well-built town (situated at the point where the torrents
of the Cembra, Fleims, and Fassa valleys, under the name of the Avisio,
are poured into the Etsch), remarkable for a red stone viaduct, nearly
3,000 feet long, near the railway station, over the Avisio. Lavis fell
into possession of the French in 1796, when the church was burnt and
the houses plundered. In 1841&mdash;forty-five years after&mdash;a
French soldier sent a sum of one hundred gulden to the church, in
reparation for having carried off a silver sanct-lamp for his share of
the booty.</p>
<p>Lavis has on many another occasions stood the early brunt of the
attacks of Tirol&rsquo;s foes, and its people have testified their full
share of loyalty. There is a tradition that the French, having on one
occasion gained possession of it with a band two hundred strong, the
people posted themselves on the neighbouring heights and harassed them
in flank; but a cobbler of Lavis, indignant at the havoc the French
were making, left this vantage ground, and running down into the town,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span>shouting &lsquo;Follow me, boys!&rsquo;
dispersed the French troops before one of his fellows had time to come
up!<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5823src" href="#xd21e5823" name=
"xd21e5823src">11</a></p>
<p>San Michel, or W&auml;lsch Michel, is the boundary town against the
circle of South Tirol, once the last town on Venetian territory. There
are imposing remains here of a fine Augustinian priory, which
originated in a castle given up to this object by Ulrich Count of Eppan
in 1143; the building has of late years been sadly neglected; it is now
a school of agriculture. A little way before W&auml;lsch Michel, the
railway crosses, for the first time since leaving Verona, to the left
bank of the Adige, by a handsome bridge called by the people &lsquo;the
<i lang="de">sechsmillionen Br&uuml;cke</i>.&rsquo; Here we leave the
Etschthal for a time, but we shall renew acquaintance with it in its
northern stretch when we come to visit South Tirol.</p>
<p>The two northern tributary valleys of the Etschthal on the west are
the Val di Non<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5839src" href="#xd21e5839"
name="xd21e5839src">12</a> and Val di Sole; among the Germans, they go
by the names of Nonsberg and Sulzberg, as if they considered the hills
in their case more striking than the valleys. The Val di Non is entered
at W&auml;lschmetz or Mezzo Lombardo by the strangely wild and gloomy
Rochettapass. W&auml;lschmetz is a flourishing Italian-looking town,
whence a stellwagen meets every train stopping at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span>San
Michel. Conveyances for exploring the valleys can be hired either at
the &lsquo;Corona&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Rosa.&rsquo; The Rochetta is
guarded by a ruined fort fantastically perched on an isolated spur of
rock called Visiaun or <span lang="it">Il Visione</span>, said to have
formed part of a system of telegraphic communication established by the
Romans.</p>
<p>In the church of Spaur Maggiore, or Spor, so called because the
principal place in the neighbourhood, which at one time all belonged to
the Counts of Spaur, is a <i lang="de">Wunderbild</i> of the Blessed
Virgin, which has for centuries attracted pilgrims from the whole
country round. The church of the next place of any importance, Denno,
is remarkably rich in marbles, and handsome for its situation; a new
altar-piece of some pretension, and a new <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e5852" title="Source: presbitery">presbytery</span>, were
completed here in August 1869. Flavone or Pflaun, the next village, is
particularly proud of a rich silver-gilt cross, twenty-five pounds in
weight, and set with pearls, a gift of a bishop of Trient. At the time
of the French invasion it was taken to Vicenza, but as soon as peace
and security were re-established the people would not rest till it was
restored to them. The hamlet is adorned with a rather handsome
municipal palazzo, built in the sixteenth century, when the ancient
Schloss, which overhangs the Trisenega torrent, was pronounced unsafe
after several earth-slips. This valley is, if possible, richer in such
remains than any other: every mountain spur bristles with them. One of
the most important and picturesque is the Schloss Belasis, near Denno,
claiming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>to be the cradle of the family of that name,
which has established itself with honour in several countries of
Europe, including our own. Behind Pflaun are large forests, which
constitute the riches of the higher, as the <i lang=

"#xd21e5859" name="xd21e5859src">13</a> is of the lower, level of the
valley. In its midst lies the <i lang="de">Wildsee</i> of Tobel, which,
frozen in winter, serves for the transport of the timber growing on the
further side. The safety of its condition for the purpose is
ascertained by observing the time when the trace of the sagacious fox
shows that he has trusted himself across.</p>
<p>Cles, situated nearly at the northernmost reach of the valley, is a
centre of the silk trade, and the factory-girls are remarkable for
their tastefully adorned hair, though they all go barefooted. The site
of a temple of Saturn, of considerable dimensions, has been found,
coinciding with traditions of his worship having been popular here; and
remains of an ancient civilization are continually dug up. There is a
wild-looking plain outside the town, still called the <i lang=
"de">Schwarzen Felder</i>, or black fields, because tradition declares
it to be the place where the Roman inhabitants burnt their dead. Here
SS. Sisinius, Martyrius, and Alexander, are believed to have suffered
death by fire on May 29, 397, because these zealous supporters and
missionaries of St. Vigilius refused to take part in a heathen
festival. St. Vigilius <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href=
"#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>no sooner heard of their steadfast
witnessing to the truth, than he repaired to the spot, and after
zealously collecting and venerating their remains, preached so
powerfully on their holy example, that great numbers were converted by
his word. A church was shortly after built here, and being the first in
the neighbourhood, was called <i lang="la">Eccelesia</i>, whence the
name of Cles. The devout spirit of these saintly guides does not seem
wanting to the present inhabitants; when the jubilee was held on
occasion of the Vatican Council, more than two thousand persons went to
Communion. At the not far distant village of Livo, on the same
occasion, it was found necessary to erect a temporary building to
supplement the large parish church, for the numbers who flocked in from
the outlying parishes. The same thing occurred when the faithful were
invited to join in prayers for the Pope after the Piedmontese invasion
of Rome, September 20, 1870.</p>
<p>On these &lsquo;Campi neri&rsquo; was found, in the spring of 1869,
a tablet since known as the &lsquo;Tavola Clesiana.&rsquo; It is a
thickish bronze tablet, about 18 in. by 13 in., with holes showing
where it was attached to a wall by the corners. It bears an inscription
in Roman character, the graving of which is quite distinct and unworn,
as if newly executed. It is as follows, and has given rise to a great
deal of controversy among arch&aelig;ologists, and between Professors
Vallaury and Mommsen, concerning its bearing on the early history of

<p>A fragment of an altar was found at the same time, with the
following words on it:&mdash;</p>

OPUS</p>
<p>Livo is the first village of the Val di Sole, which runs in a
south-westerly direction, forming nearly a right-angle with the Val di
Non, than which it is wilder, and colder, and less inhabited. At Magras
the Val di Rabbi strikes off to the north. Its baths are much
frequented, and S. Bernardo is hence provided with four or five
capacious hotels. A new church has just been built there, circular in
form, with three altars, one of which is dedicated in honour of St.
Charles <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>Borromeo, who visited the place in 1583, and
preached with so much fervour as effectually to arrest the Zuinglian
teaching, which had lately been imported.</p>
<p>Male is the chief place of Val di Sole, and contains about 1,500
inhabitants. At a retreat held here last Christmas by the Dean of Cles,
so many of them as well as of the circumjacent hamlets were attracted,
that not less than 3,000 went to communion. Further along the valley is
Mezzana, the birthplace of Antonio Maturi, who, after serving in the
campaigns of Prince Eugene, entered a Franciscan convent at Trent,
whence he was sent as a missionary to Constantinople, and was made
Bishop of Syra, and afterwards was employed as nuncio by Benedict XIV.
It was almost entirely destroyed by fire a few years ago, but is being
rapidly rebuilt. After this place the country becomes more smiling, and
cheerful cottages are seen by the wayside, with an occasional edifice,
whose solid stone-built walls suggest that it is the residence of some
substantial proprietor. The valley widens out to a plain at Pellizano,
round which lofty mountains rise on every side. The church here has a
most singular fresco on the exterior wall, which is intended to record
the circumstance that Charles Quint passed through in 1515. Some
restoration or addition was made to the church at his expense, and a
quaint inscription hints that he did it somewhat grudgingly.</p>
<p>A few miles further the valley divides into two branches, the Val di
Pejo and the Val di Vermiglio. At Cogolo, the chief place of Val di
Pejo, had long <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>been stored a magnificent monstrance, offered to
the church by Count <span class="corr" id="xd21e5913" title=
"Source: Migaezy">Megaezy</span>, who, though resident in Hungary,
owned it for his <i lang="de">Stammort</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5919src" href="#xd21e5919" name="xd21e5919src">14</a> It had long
been the admiration of the neighbourhood, and the envy of visitors; but
it was stolen by sacrilegious hands in the troubles consequent on the
invasion of the Trentino by &lsquo;<span lang=
"it">Italianissimi</span>,&rsquo; in 1849. Count Guglielmo Megaezy sent
the village a new one of considerable value and handsome design, whose
reception was celebrated amid lights and flowers, ringing of bells and
firing of <i lang="it">mortaletti</i>, July 18, 1869. This branch of
the valley is closed in by the <i lang="de">Drei Herren Spitz</i>, or
<i lang="it">Corno de&rsquo; tre Signori</i>, the boundary-mark between
the Valtellina, Bormio, and Tirol, and so called when they belonged to
three different governments. The Val di Vermiglio is closed by Monte
Tonale, the depression in whose slope forms the Tonal Pass into Val
Camonica and the Bergamese territory. Monte Tonale was notorious in the
sixteenth to early in the eighteenth century for its traditions of the
Witches&rsquo; Sabbath, and the trials for sorcery connected with
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5937src" href="#xd21e5937" name=
"xd21e5937src">15</a> Freyenthurn, a ruin-crowned peak at no great

<p class="tb"></p>
<p>On the vine-clad height of Ozolo, above Revo, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>a
few miles north of Cles, is a little village named Tregiovo, most
commandingly situated; hence, on a fine day, may be obtained one of the
most enchanting and remarkable views, sweeping right over the two
valleys. Hence a path runs up the heights, and along due north past
Cloz and Arz to Castelfondo, with its two castles overhanging the
roaring cascade of the Noce. Along this path, where it follows the
Novella torrent, numbers of pilgrims pass every year to one of the most
famed sanctuaries of Tirol&mdash;<i lang="de">Unsere liebe Frau im
Walde</i>, or <i lang="de">auf dem Gampen</i>, as the mountain on which
it is perched is called by the Germans; and this reach of the Nonstal
is almost entirely inhabited by Germans. The Italians call it <i lang=
"it">le Pallade</i>, and more commonly <i lang="it">Senale</i>. The
chapel is on the site of an ancient hospice for travellers, which
became disused, however, as early as the fourteenth century. A
highly-prized <i lang="de">Madonnabild</i>, of great sweetness of
expression, found in a swamp near the place, stands over the
high-altar. A celebration of the seventh centenary of its being found
was kept by a festival of three days from August 14, 1869, when crowds
of pilgrimages, comprising whole populations of circumjacent villages,
both German and Italian, might have been seen gathering round the
shrine. Fondo, though but a few miles distant, is a thoroughly Italian
town; and so great is the barrier this difference of tongue sets up,
that great part of the population of the one never visits the other. It
was nearly burnt down in 1865, and has hardly yet recovered from the
catastrophe; the church, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367"
href="#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>occupies a very commanding
situation, was saved, and its fine peal of six bells. Near it is St.
Biagio, where was once the only convent the Nonsthal ever possessed.
Near this again is Sanzeno, which, by a tradition a little different
from that given at Denno, is made out to be the place of martyrdom of
SS. Sisinius (supposed to be another form of the name of St. Zeno),
Martyrius, and Alexander. Their relics, at all events, are venerated
here in a marble urn behind the high-altar of the church, which bears
the title of the Cathedral of the Val de Non; and the Roman remains,
which are continually being discovered,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5973src" href="#xd21e5973" name="xd21e5973src">16</a> show that
there were Romans here to have done the martyrdom. The legend is, that
these saints were three brothers of noble family, of Cappadocia, who
put themselves under the bidding of S. Vigilius, Bishop of Trent (who
was already engaged in the conversion of the valley), <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 390. Their conversions were numerous during a series
of years; but on May 23, 397, the inhabitants of the valley, who
adhered to the old teaching, desirous to make their usual sacrifice to
obtain a blessing on their crops, called upon the Christian converts to
contribute a sheep for the purpose. On the Christians refusing a strife
ensued, of which two of the three missionaries were the immediate
victims; but the next day, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368"
href="#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span>third, Alexander was also
arrested; he was burnt alive, along with the corpses of his companions.
A church was subsequently built on the spot where they were said to
have suffered; their acts may be seen in a bas-relief of the
seventeenth century. San Zeno is also famous for being the birth-place
of Christopher Busetti, whose verses, no less than the details of his
life, earned for him the title of the Tirolean Petrarch. A little east
of San Zeno is the narrow inlet into the Romediusthal, so called from
S. Romedius, whom we heard of at Taur,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5990src" href="#xd21e5990" name="xd21e5990src">17</a> having
chosen it for a hermitage whence to evangelize the Nonsthal, and in
which to end his days. A more secluded spot could not be found on the
whole earth. Perpendicular rocks narrow it in, leaving scarcely a
glimpse of the sky above; the torrent which files its way through it,
called San Romedius-Bach, continually works a deeper and deeper bed.
Two other torrents strive for possession of the gorge
(Romediusschlucht), the Rufreddo and the Verdes, between them; near
their confluence rises a stark isolated crag, from whose highest point,
almost like a fortress, rises the far-famed hermitage, accessible only
from one side. The legend has it that S. Vigilius, knowing his exalted
piety, conceived the idea of consecrating the cell whence his holy
prayers had been poured out, for a chapel, but was warned in a vision
that angels had already fulfilled the sacred task. When this was known,
it may be imagined that the veneration of the people for it knew no
bounds, and the angelic consecration is still remembered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>by
diligent pilgrimages every first Sunday in June; the Saint&rsquo;s
feast is on January 15. The shrine is overladen with thank-offerings,
which might attract the robber in so lonely a situation. Due
precautions are taken for the preservation of the treasury; the chapel
is surrounded by strong walls, and ingress is not permitted to
strangers after nightfall. There is no record of any attempt having
been made on it but once, some thirty years ago. On this occasion three
men presented themselves at the gate, and urgently begged to be
admitted to confession; their devotion was so well assumed, and their
show of penitence so hearty, that the good priest could not refrain
from letting them in. He had scarcely taken his seat in the
confessional, however, than the three surrounded him, each presenting a
pistol at his breast; all three missed fire, and the would-be robbers,
convicted by the portent, knelt and made a real confession of their
misdeeds, and left as really penitent as they had feigned to to be on
arriving.</p>
<p>The spot has never ceased to be honoured since the death of the
saint, somewhere about 398. It is strange to stand between the walls of
the living mountain and realize the fact. There are few shrines in all
Europe which can boast of such antiquity, such unbroken tradition, and
such exemption from desecration. The building is as singular and
characteristic as the locality. The chapel, where the saint&rsquo;s
remains rest, and where he himself raised the first sanctuary of the
Nonsthal, is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>reached by one hundred and twenty-two steps,
necessarily very steep; and on attaining the last, it must be a very
steady head that can turn to survey the rise without giddiness. The
interior is quite in keeping with the surroundings. Its light is dim
and subdued, sufficient only to reveal the countless trophies of
answered prayer which cover the dark red marble columns and
enrichments. There are two other chapels at lower levels, one of the
Blessed Sacrament, called <i lang="it">del Santissimo</i>, and one over
the hermitage in the rock. Flanking this curious pile of chapels on
chapels are, on one side, the priory or residence of the chaplain of
the place, and on the other the Hospice for pilgrims and visitors, the
whole forming a considerable <i lang="fr">corps de b&acirc;timent</i>,
and enclosed by a wall which seems to have grown out of the rock.
Another little crag, jutting up as if in emulation of that so
gloriously crowned, was made into a <i lang="de">Gottesacker</i>, by a
late prior, and its churchyard cross affords it a striking termination
too; though not many monuments of the dead bristle from its sides as
yet. This singularly interesting excursion may be made direct from S.
Michel by those who have not time for visiting the whole valley. They
will pass several striking old castles, particularly that of Thun,
nearly opposite Castle Bellasi, the <i lang="de">Stammschloss</i> of
one of the oldest and noblest German families, founded by one of the
dearest companions and patrons of St. Vigilius. No other has given so
many distinguished scions to the service of the Church; Sigmund
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>von Thun was the representative of the Emperor
at the Council of Trent. There is a strong attachment between it and
the people of the valley, who delight in celebrating every domestic
event by what they call a Nonesade, or poem in the dialect of the Val
di Non. The castle is well kept up; the interior is characteristically
decorated and arranged, and many curiosities are preserved in the
library; its grounds also are charmingly laid out. It is supplied with
water by a noble aqueduct, raised in 1548, right across the valley from
Berg St. Peter; crowned also by an ancient castle, but in ruins. Few
will have a prettier page in their sketch-book than they can supply it
with here.</p>
<p>Half way between Sanzeno and Fondo, by a path which forms a loop
with that already mentioned, by Cloz and Arz, and just where the
opening into the Romediusthal strikes off, is a village named Dambel or
Dambl, where a very curious relic of antiquity, and an important one
for throwing light on the history of the earlier inhabitants of the
valley, was unearthed a couple of years ago. It is a stout, handsome
bronze key, 14&frac12; in. long, the bow ornamented with scroll-work,
which at first sight suggested the idea that it had formed part of a
comparatively modern casting of the Pontifical arms. Closer inspection
showed that on an octagonal ornament of the upper part of the stem was
an inscription, not merely engraved, but deeply cut (it is thought with
a chisel), and in perfect preservation, in characters described by a
local antiquary as &lsquo;<span lang="it">parte <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>Runiche, parte Gotiche, del Greco e Latino del

<p>The owner of the ground, Bartolo Pittschneider, the jeweller of the
village, seems to have been digging the foundation for a rustic house,
intending to make use of a remnant of a very ancient wall long thought
to have formed part of a temple of Saturn. At a depth of about 18 or 20
in. he came to a sort of pavement, or tomb or cellar covering, of
roughly-shaped stones resting against and sloping away from the base of
the ancient wall, so as to form a little enclosure. Along with the key
lay some other small objects, which unfortunately have been
dispersed,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6028src" href="#xd21e6028" name=
"xd21e6028src">18</a> but among them were two bronze coins of
<span class="corr" id="xd21e6031" title=
"Source: Maximinian">Maximilian</span> and Constantine the Great,
thought to indicate the date of the burial of the key and not that of
its manufacture.</p>
<p>This key was subsequently sent to Padre Tarquini,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6036src" href="#xd21e6036" name="xd21e6036src">19</a> and a
copy has been given me of his report upon it. He pronounced the
inscription to be undoubtedly Etruscan, but at the same time he did not
think <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>the work of the key to be of older date than the
fourth century of our era; inasmuch as there are other examples of
Etruscan writing surviving to as late a date in remote districts; that
its size and material (a mixture of silver and copper) denoted it to
belong to some important edifice, and most probably to the very temple
of Saturn amid whose ruins it was found buried. He found in it two new
forms of letters not found in other Etruscan inscriptions, but says
that similar aberrations are too common to excite surprise. He
translated it in the following form:&mdash;&lsquo;<span lang="la">Ad
introducendum virum (1) addictum igni in Vulcani (2) Vivus aduratur ob
perversitatem&mdash;incidendo incide (3)&mdash;Sceleratus est; sectam
facit; blasphemavit&mdash;In aspectu ejus ascendentes limen paveant,
videntes hominem oblitum Ejus (4) pr&aelig;stare jubilationem retinenti
ad cruciatum, tamquam hostem suum.</span>&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6047src" href="#xd21e6047" name="xd21e6047src">20</a></p>
<p>It would be curious to know how Mr. Isaac Taylor would read the
inscription by his different method, for Padre Tarquini found a curious
coincidence of circumstances to afford an interpretation to his
translation. It would seem that it was only after translating it as
above that his attention was called to the Christian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>local tradition, and then he was struck with
several points of contact between it and them. 1. The date which he had
already assigned to the key is that given by the Bollandists to the
martyrdom of St. Alexander and his two brothers. 2. It was found within
the very precincts where he was said to have been burnt, and (his
translation of) the inscription commemorates a human burnt sacrifice
(<i lang="it">il vivicomburio</i>). 3. The inscription (by his
translation) seems to allude to Christians, to their suffering
expressly for propagating their religion. 4. The inscription points to
the sacrifice having taken place in an elevated situation, as it uses
the verb &lsquo;to ascend,&rsquo; and the contemporary narrative of St.
Vigilius to St. Chrysostom of the event, as it had happened before his
eyes, says &lsquo;<span lang="la">Itum est post h&aelig;c in religiosa
fastigia, hoc est altum Dei templum ... in conspectu
Saturni.</span>&rsquo; He further goes on to approve a conjecture of
the local antiquary that the key was a votive offering made on occasion
of the martyrdom of St. Alexander with SS. Zeno and Martyrius, in
thanksgiving for the triumph over their teaching, and inscribed with
the above lines as a perpetual warning to their followers.</p>
<p>The Avisiothal&mdash;the northernmost eastern tributary of the
Etschthal&mdash;consists of three valleys running into each other; the
Val di Cembra, or Zimmerthal; the Val Fieme, or Fleimserthal; and the
Val di Fassa, or Evasthal. The Val di Cembra is throughout
impracticable for all wheeled traffic. Nature <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>has
made various rents and ledges in its porphyry sides, of which hardy
settlers have taken advantage for planting their villages, and for
climbing from one to another; but even their laborious energy has not
sufficed to make roads over such a surface. This difficulty of access
has not been without its effect in tending to keep up the honesty,
hospitality, and piety of the people; but as few will be able to
penetrate their recesses, their characteristics will be better
sacrificed to the exigencies of space than those of others. I will only
mention, therefore, the Church of Cembra, the <i lang="de">Hauptort</i>
(about four hours&rsquo; rugged walk from Lavis), which is an ancient
Gothic structure well kept up, and adorned with paintings; and a
peculiar festival which was celebrated on the Assumption-day, 1870, at
Altrei, namely, the presentation of new colours to the Schiess-stand,
by Karl von Hofer, on behalf of the Empress of Austria. One bears a
Madonna, designed by Jele of Innsbruck, on a banner of green and white
(the national colours); the other the names of the Empress
(&lsquo;Karolina Augusta&rsquo;) and the word &lsquo;<span lang=
"de">All-treu</span>,&rsquo; the original name of the village,
conferred on it by Henry Duke of Bohemia, when he permitted ten
faithful soldiers to make a settlement here free of all taxes and
customs. And yet the Italians, regardless of derivations, have made of
it Anterivo.</p>
<p>Cavalese (which can be reached in five hours by <i lang=
"de">stellwagen</i> running twice a day from the railway station at
Neumarkt) stands near the point where the Val di <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span>Cembra (which runs nearly parallel to the
railway between Lavis and Neumarkt) passes into the Fleimserthal. It is
a charmingly picturesque, thriving little town, and should not be
overlooked, for the church is a very museum of Tirolese art: painting,
sculpture, and architecture, all being due to native artists, and
highly creditable to national taste, culture, and devotion. Among these
artists were Franz Unterberger, who was chosen by the Empress Catherine
to execute copies from Raffael&rsquo;s <i>Loggie</i>, Alberti,
Riccaboni, and others, whose fame has resounded beyond the echoes of
their native mountains. Many private houses also contain works of
Tirolese art. Cavalese stands on a plateau, overlooking a magnificent
panorama, and shaded by a grove of leafy limes. Under these is a stone
table, with stone seats arranged round it, where a sort of local
parliament was formerly held. Respecting the appropriation of this
plateau for the site of the church, tradition says that in early times,
when the church was about to be built, the commune fixed upon this
plateau, in the outskirts of the town, as the most beautiful, and
therefore most appropriate, situation. But the old lady, part of whose
holding it formed, could be induced on no consideration to give it up.
Some little time after, however, she had a very serious illness; on her
sick bed she vowed, that if restored to health she would devote as much
of her fair meadow to the use <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377"
href="#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>of the church as a man could
mow in one day.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6088src" href="#xd21e6088"
name="xd21e6088src">21</a> She had no sooner registered her vow than
health returned. The commune appointed a mower, and he mowed off the
whole of the vast meadow in one day. The old lady always maintained
that there was something uncanny about it, and anyone can see for
themselves that no human mower could have done it. The Market-place is
adorned with a very handsome tower. A new church is now building, after
the design of Staidl, of Innsbruck, on the site of the little ruined
church of St. Sebastian, which shows that the study of architecture is
not neglected in Tirol. The space being very restricted, the novel
expedient has been resorted to of placing the sacristy <i lang=
"de">under</i> the sanctuary, and with good effect to the external
appearance. The former palace of the Bishops of Trent, now a prison, is
not to be overlooked. Predazzo is the only other spot in this valley we
will stop to look at. The extraordinary geological formation of the
neighbourhood has attracted many men of science to the place, whose
names may be seen in the strangers&rsquo; book. The people are
singularly thrifty and industrious. A high road connecting it with
Primiero is just completed, which is to be continued to meet the
railway projected between Belluno and Treviso. A new church is being
raised there, of proportions and design quite remarkable for so remote
a place. It was begun simultaneously with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span>troubles in Italy, in 1866, and a creditable
amount has been since laid out upon it. The lofty vaulting of the nave
is supported by ten monolithic columns of granite; the floor is paved
with hard cement, arranged in patterns formed in colour; the smaller
pillars, doors, steps, mouldings, are all of granite; much of the
tracery is very artistic; the windows are of creditable painted glass,
though not free from the German vice of over-shading. The architect is
Michel Maier, of Trent; the elegant campanile by Geppert, of Innsbruck.
It will be the largest church in the whole of W&auml;lsch-Tirol, after
the Cathedral of Trent. The interior arrangements and decoration bid
fair to be worthy of the structure. There is some good polychrome in
the presbytery, by Ciochetti, a young artist, native of the village of
Moena, in Fassathal, who in the last five years has had eleven medals
from the Academy of Fine Arts at Venice. It is the custom all through
the valley that each village should have its own gay banner, which is
carried before bridal processions to and from the church. But at
Predazzo they have many other peculiarities; among these is the
following:&mdash;The night before the wedding the bridegroom goes to
the house of the bride, accompanied by a party of musicians, knocks at
the door, and demands his bride. The eldest and least well-favoured
member of the household is then brought to him, on which a humorous
altercation takes place and a less ancient dame is brought, and so on,
till all have been passed in review, and then the intended <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>bride herself is brought at last, who admits the
swain to the evening meal of the family. The friends and neighbours
then come in, and bring their wedding gifts to the loving pair.</p>
<p>The Fassathal begins just after Moena. One of its wildest legends is
that of the <i lang="de">feuriger Verr&auml;ther</i>. It dates from the
time of the Roman invasion. The mountain-dwellers appear to have been
as zealous defenders of their native fastnesses then as in later times,
and it is said the conquering legions were long wandering round the
confines without finding any who would lead them into the interior of
the country. It was at last an inhabitant of the Fassathal who betrayed
the narrow pass which was the key to their defences, and which cost the
liberty of the nation&mdash;all for the sake of the proffered
blood-money. But he was never suffered to enjoy it; for a flash like
lightning, though under a clear sky, struck him to the earth, and ever
since, the traitor has been to be met by night wrapt in flames, and
howling piteously.</p>
<p>Vigo is the principal town, and serves as the starting-point for the
magnificent mountain excursions of the neighbourhood. The most
difficult of these, and one only to be attempted by the well-seasoned
Alpine climber,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6109src" href="#xd21e6109"
name="xd21e6109src">22</a> is that of the massive snow-clad Marmolata,
10,400 feet high, surnamed the Queen of the Dolomites; but she is a
severe and haughty queen, who knows <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb380" href="#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>how to hold her own,
and keep intruders at a distance; and many who have been enchanted with
her stern beauty from afar have rued the attempt at intruding on the
cold solitude of her eternal penance. For the legends tell that in her
youth she was covered with verdant charms, which made her the delight
of the people; but they were not content to use with pious moderation
the precious gifts she had in store, and for some sin of
theirs&mdash;some say for selfish disregard of the law of charity to
the poor;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6114src" href="#xd21e6114" name=
"xd21e6114src">23</a> some say for disregard of the Church&rsquo;s law

"pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=
"pb381">381</a>]</span>striving for the possession of the
soil&mdash;the vengeance of Heaven overtook them, and the once smiling
meadows were converted into the hard and barren glacier. Near Vigo is a
little way-side chapel, highly prized, because near it some French
soldiers in the invasion of 1809 lost their way, and the town was thus
saved from their depredations; and the legend arose that the
Madonnabild had stricken them blind. Several of them died of falls and
hunger, and tradition says, that on wild nights notes of distress from
a dying bugler&rsquo;s horn may be heard resounding still.</p>
<p>The Avisio was once the boundary against Venetian territory; and St.
Ulrich dying on its banks, on his return from Rome, exacted of his
disciples a promise that they would carry his body across, so that he
might find his final rest on German soil. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

been grafted on to Tirol. W&auml;lsch-Tirol, however, has its own

is no tradition more universally spread over Tirol than that which
tells of judgments falling on non-observers of days of rest. They are,
however, by no means confined to Tirol. Ludovic Lalanne, <i lang=
"fr">Curiosit&eacute;s des Traditions</i>, vol. iv. p. 136, says that
the instances he had collected showed it was treated as a fault most
grievous to heaven. &lsquo;<span lang="fr">Matthieu Paris, &agrave;
l&rsquo;ann&eacute;e 1200, raconte qu&rsquo;une pauvre blanchisseuse

s&rsquo;attacha &agrave; sa mamelle gauche.</span>&rsquo; He relates
one or two other curious instances&mdash;one of a young girl who,
having insisted on working on a holiday, somehow got the knot of her
thread twisted into her tongue, and every attempt to remove it gave
intolerable pain. Ultimately she was healed by praying at the
Lady-altar at Noyon, and here the knot of thread was long shown in the
sacristy.</p>
<p class="footnote">I well remember the English counterpart in my own
nursery. There were, indeed, two somewhat analogous stories; and I
often wondered, without exactly daring to ask, why there was so much
difference in the tone in which they were told, for the one seemed to
me as good as the other. The first, which used to be treated as an
utter imposture, was that a woman and her son surreptitiously obtained
a consecrated wafer for purposes of incantation (we have had a Tirolean
counterpart of this at Sistrans, <i>supra</i> pp. 221&ndash;2), and in
pursuit of their weird operation had pierced it, when there flowed
thereout such a prodigious stream of blood that the whole place was
inundated, and all the people drowned. The second, which was told with
something of seriousness in it, (&lsquo;and they say, mind you,
<i>that</i> actually happened,&rsquo;) was of a young lady who, having
persisted in working on Sunday in spite of all her nurse&rsquo;s
injunctions, pricked her finger. No one could stop the bleeding that
ensued, and she bled to death for a judgment; and whether it was true
or not, there was a monument to her in Westminster Abbey. Dean Stanley,
who seems to have missed nothing that could possibly be said about the
Abbey, finds place, I see, to notice even this tradition (pp.
219&ndash;20 and note), and identifies it with the monument of
Elizabeth Russell (born 1575) in St. Edmund&rsquo;s Chapel. Madame
Parkes-Belloc tells me she has often seen a wax figure of a lady (in
the costume of two centuries later than Elizabeth Russell) under a
glass case in Gosfield Hall, Essex (formerly a seat of the Buckingham
family), of which a similar tradition is told.</p>

<p class="first">Val Sugana is watered by the Brenta through its whole
course, running nearly direct east from Trent. It is reached by the
Adler Thor, and over the handsome bridge of S. Ludovico, through
luxuriant plantations of mulberries and vines, and with many a summer
villa on either hand. The road leads (at a considerable and toilsome
distance) to the low range of hills (in Tirol called a <i lang=
"de">Sonnenberg</i>) of Baselga, locally named Pin&egrave;, whose sides
are studded with a number of villages and groups of houses. In one of
these, Verda or Guarda by name, near the village of Montanaga, is the
most celebrated pilgrimage of the Trentino&mdash;the Madonna di
Pin&egrave;, also known as the Madonna di Caravaggio. It was the year
1729; a peasant girl, Domenika Targa, native of Verda, who was noted by
all her neighbours for the angelic holiness of her life, had lost some
of her herd upon the mountain one hot August day; in her distress, she
knelt down to ask for help to bring back her charge faithfully.
Suddenly the place was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href=
"#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>bathed in a light of glory, and
before her stood a lady so benign and glorious, she could be none other
than the <i lang="de">Himmelsk&ouml;nigin</i>. &lsquo;Go, my child, and
tell them that you have seen me here, and that I have chosen this spot
for my delight; and that their prayers will be heard which they offer
before the picture of the Madonna di Caravaggio.&rsquo; The light faded
away, and Domenika turned to seek her flock. She found them all in
order, waiting for her to drive them home. There was considerable
discussion after this as to what &lsquo;Madonna di Caravaggio&rsquo;
might mean; and it was at last decided that it could mean nothing but
the picture of the Madonna by Caldara, surnamed Caravaggio from his
birthplace, venerated at Milan. Domenika could not leave her herds to
go to Milan, and she was perplexed how to obey the vision. In her
simple faith she addressed her prayer on high for further direction,
and once more the heavenly sight was vouchsafed to her, and it was
explained that the <i lang="de">Madonnabild</i> meant was not that of
Milan, but the one in the little field-chapel of S. Anna, near
Montanaga. Domenika did not fail to go there the next festival on which
it was open, the Ascension Day, which was, that year, May 26. Above the
faint light of the tapers tempered by the incense clouds, and amid the
chanted litanies of the choir, the fair Queen once more appeared to her
in garments of gold, and surrounded by a glittering train of
attendants. Some months passed, and though the people had wondered at
the marvel, nothing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384"
name="pb384">384</a>]</span>had been done to commemorate it; Domenika
was kneeling, on September 8, the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, in
the Chapel of S. Anna. A sound of soft chanting broke on her ear, which
she thought must be the procession of the parish coming up the hill to
pray for rain. But as it grew nearer, the same heavenly radiance
overspread the place, and once more she saw the Virgin Mother; but this
time she looked stern, for the great favour of her visit had been
overlooked, and she reasoned with Domenika on the ingratitude it
betokened. Domenika honestly outspoke her inward cogitations on the
subject&mdash;what could a poor cattle-herd do? It was given her to
understand that much might be done even by such a poor peasant, if she
exercised energy and devotion. With new strength and determination, she
girt herself for the task of building a shrine over the spot so dear to
her. At first she met with great ridicule and scorn, but she pursued
her way so steadily and so humbly, that all were won to share her
convictions. Offerings for the work began to flow in. Those who had no
money gave their corn, or their grapes, their ornaments, and their very
clothes. Year by year the new church rose, according as she could
collect the means; and at last, on May 26, 1751, she had the
consolation of seeing the complete edifice consecrated. It is a neat
cruciform building, sixty-three feet long and fifty-three feet wide,
with three marble altars, on one of which is a copy of the Madonna di
Caravaggio of Milan painted by Jakob <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb385" href="#pb385" name="pb385">385</a>]</span>Moser after he had
made three pilgrimages to the original. I was not able to ascertain
what was supposed to have been intended in the first instance by
calling the old picture in S. Anna&rsquo;s field-chapel the Madonna di
Caravaggio. Possibly the little Milanese town, which has given two
painters to fame, had produced some &lsquo;mute inglorious&rsquo;
&lsquo;Caravaggio,&rsquo; who painted the earlier picture. The
commemoration of Domenika&rsquo;s vision is celebrated every year in
Val Pin&egrave; by pilgrimages on May 26 when the most striking
gatherings of Tirolese costume are to be observed there.</p>
<p>Pergine is the first large village on returning into the main
valley, about six miles from Trent. It well deserves to be better
known: the neighbourhood is of great beauty, and the form of the
surrounding heights is well likened by the inhabitants to a theatre.
The church, built in 1500&ndash;45, is spacious and handsome, adorned
in the interior with red marble columns. In the churchyard are the
remains of the older church, where every Lent German sermons are still
preached for the benefit of the scattered German population, whose name
for the place is Persen. The German and Italian elements within the
village are blended with tolerable amity. From the fourteenth to the
sixteenth centuries, silver, copper, lead, and iron, were got out in
the neighbouring Fersinathal; and though the works are now nearly given
up, the <i lang="de">Knappen</i> then formed an important portion of
the community. They cast the bell as an offering to the church when
building, and it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386"
name="pb386">386</a>]</span>is still called the <i lang=
"de">Knappinn</i>&mdash;by the Italians <i lang=
"it">can&ograve;ppa</i>. The chief industry now is silk-spinning. The
greatest ornament of the place is the <i lang="de">Schloss</i> of the
Bishop of Trent, which is well kept up, and from the roof of which an
incomparable view is obtained. Among the peculiar customs of the place
those concerning marriages deserve to be recorded, as they tend to show
the character of the people. Two young men of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
friends are selected for the office of <i lang="de">Brumoli</i> so
called; they have to carry, the one a barn-door fowl, the other a
spinning-wheel, before the bride as she goes to and from church, to
remind her of her household duties. After the wedding, as she returns
with her husband to his house the door is suddenly closed as she
approaches, and there is then carried on a dialogue, according to an
established form, between her and her husband&rsquo;s mother&mdash;the
latter requiring, and the former undertaking, that she will prove
herself God-fearing and domesticated; that she will be faithful and
devoted to her husband, and live in charity with all his family. The
little ceremony complete, the mother-in-law throws wide the door, and
receives her with open arms.</p>
<p>On the south side of the valley, opposite Pergine, is the clear lake
of Caldonazzo, whose waters reflect the bright green chestnut woods
around it; it is the source of the Brenta, and one of the largest lakes
of Tirol; about three miles long, and half as broad. Count Welfersheim,
an Austrian general, and his adjutant, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb387" href="#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>were drowned in
attempting to walk over the thin ice on it in March 1871. On a rugged
promontory jutting into its midst stands the most ancient sanctuary of
the neighbourhood, San Cristofero; once a temple to Saturn and Diana,
but adopted for a Christian church by the earliest evangelizers of the
valley, for which reason the produce of the soil and waters yet pays
tithe to the presbytery of Pergine. Other villages add to the
surrounding beauties of the lake, particularly Campolongo, with its
church of St. Teresa high above the green waters, and the church and
hermitage of San Valentin; the latter is now used for a <i lang=
"it">roccolo</i>, or <i lang="de">vogeltennen</i>, by which numbers of
birds of passage are caught on their migrations. The land is very poor.
To eke out their living, most of the male inhabitants of the villages
around are wont to go out every winter as pedlars, with various small
articles manufactured in the valley, and with which they are readily
trusted by those who stay behind. On their return, which is always at
Easter, they distribute honourably what they have earned for each,
deducting a small commission. So straightforward and honourable are
they, that though they have little idea of keeping accounts, and the
sums are generally made out with a bit of chalk on the inn table, yet
it is said that such a thing as a dispute over the amounts is utterly
unknown. The church of St. Hermes, at Calzeranica, is reckoned the most
ancient of the whole neighbourhood; remains of an ancient temple,
thought to have been to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href=
"#pb388" name="pb388">388</a>]</span>Diana of Antioch, have been found
when repairing it. In the forest behind Bosentino, a neighbouring
village, is a pilgrimage chapel called <i lang="it">Nossa Signora del
feles</i>; <i lang="de">die h. Jungfrau vom Farrenkraut</i>&mdash;St.
Mary of the Fern. Some two hundred years ago, Gianisello, a little dumb
boy of Bosentino, who was minding his father&rsquo;s herd in the
forest, was visited by a bright lady, who pointed to a tuft of fern
growing under a chestnut tree, and bid him go and tell the village
people she would have them built a chapel there. When the people heard
the boy tell his story, who for all the twelve years of his life had
never spoken a word before, they felt no doubt it was the Blessed
Virgin he had seen. The chapel was soon built, and furnished with a
painting embodying the little boy&rsquo;s story. In time of dearth,
drought, epidemic, or other local calamity, many are the processions
which may yet be seen wending their prayerful way to the chapel of St.
Mary of the Fern.</p>
<p>Among the wild and beautiful legends of this part of the valley is a
variant of one familiar in every land. A young swain, the maiden of
whose choice was called to an early grave, went wandering through the
chestnut groves calling for his beloved, till he grew weary with
crying, and laid him down in a cave to rest. A sweet sleep visited him,
and he found himself in it at home as of old in the Valle del
Orco,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6222src" href="#xd21e6222" name=
"xd21e6222src">1</a> with his Filomena on his arm; he led her to the
village church, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href=
"#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>silver-haired pastor gave the
marriage blessing, while all the village prayed around. He brought
Filomena home to his old house, <i lang="it">alle
Settepergole</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6232src" href="#xd21e6232"
name="xd21e6232src">2</a> his dear old father and mother welcomed her,
and she brought sunshine into the cottage; and when they were called
away the old walls were yet not without life and joy, for it resounded
to the voice of the prattling little ones. The little ones grew up into
stalwart lads and lasses, who earned homesteads of their own, and
erewhile brought another tribe of prattling little ones to his knee;
while Filomena smiled a bright sunshine over all, and they were so
happy they prayed it might never end: but one day it seemed that the
sunshine of Filomena&rsquo;s smile was not felt, for she was no longer
there; then all grew pale and cold, and with a sudden chill he woke. It
was grey morning as he rose from the cave; the cattle were lowing as
they were led out to pasture; he looked out towards the chestnut
groves, and watched in their waving foliage the strange effect which
had been the charm of his childhood, looking like rippled ocean pouring
abroad its flood.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6240src" href="#xd21e6240"
name="xd21e6240src">3</a> But when he reached the village the sights
and sounds were no more so familiar: the old church tower was capped
with a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name=
"pb390">390</a>]</span>steeple, of which he never saw the like; the
folk he met by the way were all strangers, and stared at him as at one
who comes from far. He wandered up and down all the day, and everything
was yet strange. At evening the men came back from the fields, and
again they gazed at him estranged: once he made bold to ask them for
&lsquo;Zansusa,&rsquo; the companion of his boyhood, but they shrugged
their shoulders with a &lsquo;Ch&egrave; Zansusa?&rsquo; and passed on.
He asked again for &lsquo;Piero,&rsquo; almost as dear a friend, and
they pointed to a &lsquo;Piero&rsquo; with not one feature like
<i>his</i> Peter. Once again he asked for &lsquo;Franceschi,&rsquo; and
they pointed to a grave, where his name was written
indeed&mdash;&lsquo;Franceschi,&rsquo; who but the day before had
walked with him in full life and health, to hang a fresh wreath on
Filomena&rsquo;s cross! Ah! there was Filomena&rsquo;s cross, but how
changed was that too! the bright gilding, on which his savings had been
so willingly lavished, was tarnished and weather-worn, and not a leaf
of his garland remained round it. He wandered no further, nor sought to
fathom the mystery more; he knelt on the only spot of earth that had
any charm for him. As his knees touched the hallowed soil consoling
thoughts of her undying affection overflowed him. &lsquo;Here we are
united again,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;in a little while we shall be
united for ever.&rsquo; &lsquo;At last have I found thee! these fifty
years I have sought thee in vain!&rsquo; The moonbeam kissed his
forehead as he looked up, and the moonbeam bore her who had spoken. A
fair form she wore, but still it was not the form of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>Filomena. &lsquo;Who are you, and wherefore
sought you me?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;I am <span class=
"sc">Death</span>,&rsquo; replied the pale maiden, &lsquo;and for fifty
years I have sought thee to lead thee to Filomena.&rsquo; She beckoned
as she spoke, and willingly he followed her whither the moonbeam
led.</p>
<p>The village of Caldonazzo, with its ancient castle, is another
ornament of the lake. Further south is the village of Lavarone, or
Lafraun, accessible only to the pedestrian. A house close to the edge
of a little lake here is pointed out, which in olden time was the
residence of two brothers, the owners of the meadow over which the lake
is now spread. These two could never agree; their strife grew from day
to day, till at last one night they called each other out to settle
their quarrels once for all by mortal combat. The noise of the strife
within had made them oblivious to the strife of the elements which was
waging without. The gust which entered as the eldest turned to open the
cottage door, and the blinding rain, drove them back; even their fierce
passions seemed mastered by the fiercer fury without. In silence they
returned into the room, and neither cared to raise his voice amid the
angry voices of the storm, which now made themselves heard solemnly
indeed. In sullen silence they passed the night, and during the silence
there was time for reflection; each would have been glad to have backed
out of the promised fight, but neither had the courage to propose a
reconciliation. Sullenly they rose with the morning light; the pale
gold rays rested on the trees, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392"
href="#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span>now calm and tranquil, and
both shuddered to carry their vengeance out on to the fair scene; but
neither dared speak, and once more the eldest opened the door. This
time it was not the rain descending from above which drove him back; it
was the flood rising from beneath! The Centa torrent had overflowed.
The disputed meadow had become a lake, and with their united efforts
they scarcely kept the waters banked out. The community of labour, of
danger, and of distress, ended the strife; and though their worldly
possessions were lost to them for ever, they had found a greater boon,
the bond of fraternal charity.</p>
<p>I must pass over Levico, near which the Brenta has its source, and
the intervening villages; but Borgo di Val Sugan&rsquo; demands our
attention for its beautiful situation. The view over both may be
enjoyed by mountain climbers from the neighbouring height of Vezzena.
Borgo is commonly called the Italian Meran, for its likeness with that
favourite watering-place. Its buildings extend over both sides of the
Brenta, being united by a massive stone bridge, built in 1498. Those on
the left bank were nearly destroyed by fire in 1862, but the rebuilding
has been carried on with great spirit. Its ecclesiastical buildings do
not date far back; the rebuilding of the parish church in 1727 nearly
obliterated all traces of the earlier edifice; its chief glories are
three paintings it possesses, one by Titian&rsquo;s brother, one by
Karl Loth, and one by Rothmayr. The fine campanile was added in 1760.
There is also a Franciscan convent, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb393" href="#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>but it does not date
back further than 1603, there is the following curious tradition of its
origin.</p>
<p>The Sellathal leading to Sette Comuni, is narrowed by two mighty
cliffs&mdash;the Rochetta on the south, and the Grolina on the north,
adorned with the ruined Castel San Pietro,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6264src" href="#xd21e6264" name="xd21e6264src">4</a> seemingly
perched above all human reach. On a green knoll beneath it stand the
lordly remains of Castel Telvana; its frescoes are now nearly faded
away, only a room here and there is habitable; but its enduring walls
and towers show of what strength it was in the days long gone
by&mdash;days such as those in which Anna, wife of Siccone di
Caldonazzo, defended it with so much spirit against all the might of
Friedrich <i lang="de">mit der leeren Tasche</i>, that she obtained the
right to an honourable capitulation. It was bought by the Counts of
Welsburg in 1465, and henceforth it became an abode of pleasure rather
than a mere fortress. Count Sigmund von Welsburg, who was its master
towards the end of the sixteenth century, was particularly disposed to
make his residence in their midst a boon to the inhabitants of Borgo,
and entered heartily into all the pastimes of the people. It happened
thus that the Carneval procession of the year 1598 was invited to take
the Castel Telvana for its bourne; and that the women might not be
fatigued by the ascent, the Count gallantly provided them all with
horses from his own stud. The valley resounded with merriment as they
wended their way up in their varied and fantastic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name=
"pb394">394</a>]</span>attire. Arrived at the castle, good cheer was
provided, which none were slow to turn to account, and the return was
commenced in no less boisterous humour. At the most precarious spot of
the giddy declivity, the courage of the foremost rider forsook her; the
Count&rsquo;s high-couraged charger, which she bestrode, perceiving the
slackened pressure on the rein, grew nervous and bewildered too, and
uneasy to find himself for the first time subjected to devious
guidance. The indecision of the first fair cavalier alarmed her sister,
who followed next behind&mdash;a shriek was the expression of the
alarm, which communicated itself to the next rider, and in a moment a
panic had possessed the whole <span class="corr" id="xd21e6272" title=
"Source: calvacade">cavalcade</span>, or nearly the whole; for the few
who here and there still retained their presence of mind were powerless
to make those before them advance, or to keep back the threatening
tramp of those behind. The Count saw the danger, and the one remedy.
First registering a vow, that if he succeeded in his daring enterprise
he would build a convent to the honour of God and St. Francis, he set
out along the brink of the narrow track, where there was scarce a
foot-breadth between him and the abyss, past the whole file of the
snorting horses and their terrified burdens. He had this in his favour,
that every denizen of his stable recognised him as he went by, and his
presence soothed their chafing. Arrived at last safely at the head of
the leading steed, his hand on its mane was enough to restore its
<span class="corr" id="xd21e6275" title=
"Source: condence">confidence</span>; securely he led it to the full
end of the dangerous pass, and all the others followed in docile
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>order behind. The Count did not forget his vow,
nor would he in his gratitude allow any other hand to diminish the
outlay he had undertaken. The convent buildings are now in part turned
to secular uses, though part is also used for a hospital, where all the
sick of the town are freely tended. In the church is an altarpiece of
Lazarus begging at the gate of Dives, by Lorenzo Fiorentini, a native
artist.</p>
<p>The pass I have mentioned between the Rochetta and the
Grolina&mdash;the importance of which as a defence was not unknown to
the Romans, of whose remains the town possesses a considerable
collection dug up at different times&mdash;was not without its share of
work in the French invasions of 1796 and 1809. In the former, a handful
of Tirolese successfully repulsed five hundred of the enemy in an
obstinate encounter of three hours&rsquo; duration. In the latter, the
place was attacked by tenfold greater numbers. General Ruska was so
infuriated, not only by their determined and galling fire, but by the
derisive shouts and gestures of the mountaineers, who carried their
daring so far as to fling the dead bodies of the soldiers they had
killed down under the wheels of his carriage, that he ordered the
pillage and destruction of the town. His guns were ready planted to
pour out their murderous fire, when the parish priest, heading a
procession of aged house-fathers, came to implore him to spare their
homes. At the same moment news was brought him that two Austrian
battalions were advancing with dangerous haste. One or other of the
considerations thus urged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href=
"#pb396" name="pb396">396</a>]</span>effected the deliverance of the
town, which was only required to buy itself off at the price of a large
supply of provisions.</p>
<p>Borgo has further advantage of the mineral spring of Zaberle, and a
creditable theatre. Silk-spinning is again the chief industry of the
place; and there are several so-called <i>Filatoriums</i>, employing a
great number of hands. The most remarkable excursions in the
neighbourhood are to the deserted hermitage of San Lorenzo and the
stalactite caves of Costalta, both in the Sellathal, whence there is a
path leading to the curiously primitive and typically upright community
of the <i lang="it">Sette Comuni</i>.</p>
<p>Pursuing the valley further in its easterly course, I must not omit
to mention Castelalto, not only remarkable for its share in the
medi&aelig;val history of Tirol, but for being still well kept up. At
Strigno, one of the largest hamlets of the valley, is another ancient
castle, which after its abandonment in the fourteenth century acquired
the name of Castelrotto. The parish church, rebuilt in 1827, contains a
Madonna del Rosario by Domenichino; and a Mater Dolorosa in Carrara
marble, by the Venetian sculptor Melchiori. This is the generally
adopted starting-place for the Cima d&rsquo;Asta, the highest peak of
the Trentino (8,561 feet), and commanding a panorama of exceptional
magnificence. Under favourable circumstances it is reached within
thirty hours, sleeping in the open at Quarazza. The interest of the way
is heightened by two considerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397"
href="#pb397" name="pb397">397</a>]</span>lakes; the lower, that of
Quarazza, closed in by wall-like cliffs, is fed by a cascade from the
higher lake, which receives several torrents. Near the summit is a
garnet quarry. Just below Strigno is another inhabited castle, that of
Ivano, belonging to the Count of Wolkenstein-Trostburg, who makes it a
summer residence. The church is dedicated to S. Vindemian; near it was
once a hermitage. Further down the valley is Ospedaletto, famous in
border warfare, and once a hospice for travellers, served by monks,
still a mountain-inn with a chapel attached. Grigno has another
once-important castle. S. Udalric, Bishop of Augsburg, had occasion to
pass through the village on his way to Rome in the time of Pope Sergius
III. (<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 904&ndash;11), and left behind him
so profound an impression of his sanctity, that the devotion of the
people to his memory has never diminished. In the eleventh century a
chapel was built in his honour, with the picturesque instinct of the
people of that date, on the steep way leading to Castel Tesino. It was
always kept in good condition till 1809, when it was desecrated by the
French soldiery. It was restored within ten years, and a rustic piazza
in front planted with lime trees, which have at the present time
attained considerable dimensions. In July 1869, processions consisting
of more than four thousand villagers met at this shrine, to pray for
deliverance from the heavy rains, which were causing the inundation of
their homesteads.</p>
<p>From Grigno there is a path which few persons however <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>will
be tempted to follow, across the so-called Canal San Bovo, to Primiero,
a country which has already been so ably laid open to the tourist that
I need not attempt a fresh description of its beauties. If any one
penetrates its recesses as far as the village of Canal San Bovo, I
think they will not be sorry to have been advised to ask for a certain
Virginia Loss, who has a touching story to tell them of her adventures.
On a stormy day, the last of October 1869, she was making her way,
though only thirteen, with her mother and another woman, along the
dangerous path leading hither from the Fleimserthal, following their
occupation of carriers. They had passed Panchi&agrave; and Ziano, and
were in the midst of the verdant tract known as the Sadole. The fierce
wind that blew exhausted her poor mother&rsquo;s strength, and she saw
no help but to lay down her burden by the way, and try to reach home
with bare life. Domenica Orsingher, the other woman, however, who had
already got on a good way beyond her, no sooner learned what she had
done than, considering what a loss it must be to her, with a humble
heroism went back to fetch the pack intending to carry it in addition
to her own! The next day some men travelling by the same path found her
body extended by the wayside. She had died of cold and exhaustion.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The land is strong with such as these,</p>
<p class="line xd21e1303">Her heroes&rsquo; destined mothers.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Further along they found Elisabetta Loss and her
daughter huddled together. On carrying the bodies to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span>Cauria they <span class="corr" id="xd21e6314"
title="Source: succeded">succeeded</span> in reviving only the child.
Virginia has a tragic story to tell of; of how her mother sank to her
rest, and her own unavailing and inexperienced efforts to call her to
life; then the horror of the approaching night, the snow storm in which
she expected to be covered up and lost to sight, yet had not strength
to move away; and, worst of all, the circling flight of crows and
ravens which she spent her last energies in driving with her
handkerchief from her mother&rsquo;s face; and yet the presence of
death, solitude and helplessness, made the approach of even those
rapacious and ill-omened companions seem almost less unwelcome. The
insensibility which ensued was probably the most welcome visitant of
all.</p>
<p>Le Tezze is a smaller village than Grigno, but one that has done
good service to the patriotic cause, having many a time stayed the
advance of invading hosts; and never more successfully than in the
latest Garibaldian attempt on the Trentino, upon the cession of Venice
by Austria after Sadowa. The tombs of the bold mountaineers who fell
while driving back the tenfold numbers opposed to them are to be seen
appropriately ranged along the stony declivity they defended so well.
These graves are yearly visited by their brethren on the 14th of
August.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">They fell devoted and undying,</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=

<p>Le Tezze is the last Tirolean village of the valley, and the seat of
the Austrian custom-house against Italy. On the other side of this
frontier is the interesting Italian town of Primolano, whence there is
an easier way into Primiero-thal than by crossing the Canal San Bovo.
Val Sugana retains more of the German element than any other district
of W&auml;lsch-Tirol.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Judicarien or Giudicaria bifurcates westwards and south-westwards
from the Etschthal opposite Val Sugana. Its first (south-west) division
is called the Sarcathal and reaches to the Lago di Garda. Though no
part of the beautiful Italian lake actually belongs to Tirol the town
of Riva overlooks it; the country round is most productive in wine,
silk, lemons, figs, and other fruits. Its pleasant climate, the warmest
in all Tirol, is due not only to its southern latitude, but also to its
being the lowest land of the principality. Innsbruck is 1,820 feet
above the sea-level, Riva but 220. From the western division of
Giudicaria there branch out northwards Val Rendena, north-westwards Val
Breguzzo and Val Daone, and southwards Val Bona. The Val di Ledro or
Lederthal, forms a parallel return towards the Garda-See. Here an
attempt at invasion headed by Garibaldi was repulsed by the Innsbruck
Student-brigade in 1866 at a pass called Bezzecca.</p>
<p>Giudicaria is little explored yet it contains some choice scenery
and traditions. Castel Madruzz, which can be visited from Trent, is one
of its most ancient <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401"
name="pb401">401</a>]</span>and important castles. From the twelfth to
the seventeenth century, the family which inhabited it and bore its
name takes a foremost place in Tirol&rsquo;s history. In the church are
shown the portraits of seven of the family ascribed to Titian. From
1530 to 1658 four of its members occupied the See of Trent, and were
successively invested with the Cardinalitial dignity. Cardinal Karl
Madruzz became the last of his house. All his kindred having died
without heirs, he applied to Rome for permission to marry&mdash;a
dispensation which we have seen once before accorded in favour of a
Tirolese prince. Cardinal Madruzz preferred his suit successively
before Urban VIII., Innocent X., and Alexander VII., and at last
obtained it, coupled with the proviso that he should only marry in his
own station. As this did not accord with his intentions, the favour so
tardily granted was never acted on. This fine castle had fallen into
sad neglect but it is being restored. From its deserted terraces a
glorious view is obtained, which takes in the two lakes of Toblino to
the north, and Cavedine to the south, both being fed by the same
torrents. Round the Lago di Cavedine lie the flowery slopes which bear
the name of Abraham&rsquo;s Garden. The Lake of Toblino is broken into
by a picturesque promontory, bearing the castellated villa of the
Prince-Bishops of Trent; though on flat ground, the round turrets at
the angles with their pointed caps afford a wonderful relief to the
landscape. The village is called Sta. Massenza, from the mother of S.
Vigilius, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name=
"pb402">402</a>]</span>who died here in the odour of sanctity, 381. Her
relics were translated to Trent, 1120. At the foot of the height on
which stands Schloss Madruzz is a double chapel, on the model of the
Holy House of Loreto, the legend being inscribed on the walls.</p>
<p>At the westernmost reach of Giudicaria, the Rendenathal branches off
towards Val di Sole. It was the cradle of the evangelization of Tirol,
for here S. Vigilius suffered martyrdom, 405, and the valley is rife
with traditions of him. He appears to have been stirred with zeal for
the propagation of the faith at a very early age; and his piety and
earnestness were so apparent that he was consecrated Bishop of Trent at
the age of twenty. He made many conversions, and built a church to SS.
Gervasius and Protasius, <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 375. But he was
not content with establishing the faith here, and sending out
missionaries hence; he would wander himself on foot through all the
valleys where paganism still lurked, overturning idols and building
Christian sanctuaries&mdash;more than thirty trace their origin to his
work. Nowhere did he meet with so much opposition as in the
Rendenathal, which was the last to accept the yoke of Christ. But he
was untiring in his apostolic labours, nor could he rest while
<i>one</i> token of a false religion remained erect. It is not to be
supposed that, though he made many fervent converts, he effected all
this without also exciting the opposition and fury of those whose
teaching he had come to supersede. Yet though <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name="pb403">403</a>]</span>many
were the snares set for him, no conspiracy against him succeeded till
he had cast down the last idol. It was at Mortaso, one of the remotest
villages of this secluded dell, he stood announcing the &lsquo;glad
tidings&rsquo; of the Gospel from the pedestal of the image he had
overthrown, and the population crowded round, earnestly garnering in
his words. He had left off preaching, and just raised his hands in
benediction, when a body of heathen men and women, who had long
determined to compass his end, rushed upon the scene from the
surrounding grove, and stoned him with the fragments of the image he
had overthrown. His hearers would have defended him, but he knew that
his hour was come, for his work was accomplished; and forbidding all
strife, he knelt down, and folding his arms on his breast meekly
rendered up his spirit, while his constancy won many to the faith. His
disciples reverently gathered his remains and bore them to Trent; but
as soon as his murderers were aware of their intent, they set out to
follow them. The Christian party, delayed by the weight of their
burden, found that their pursuers were fast gaining ground. In this
strait, says the legend, they called upon the rocky wall before
them&mdash;</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Apritevi, O sassa,</p>
<p class="line">Che S. Vigilio passa,</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd21e2322">and behold before them suddenly appeared a
cleft in the rock, through which they passed in safety, and which is
pointed out to this day. Another narrow <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb404" href="#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span>cleft is pointed out
near Cadine, which is said to have been rent asunder at his bidding,
when once, at an earlier stage of his labours, he deemed it right to
flee from those who would have taken his life. The <i lang="it">Acqua
della Vela</i> now passes through it, and a dent is shown which is said
to mark the place where the saint impressed his hand on the obedient
stone. It was this suggested to the bearers of the bier to make a
similar appeal on behalf of his relics. It is commonly reported that in
Mortaso the bread never rises properly; and they couple with it this
tradition, that when the pieces of the broken idol sufficed not for all
who would attack the saint, the women brought out loaves from the oven
to complete the work.</p>
<p>The Rendenathal also preserves the memory of S. Julian, called also
Sent Ugiano and San Zulian in local dialect. His legend says he lived
with his parents in an outlying house. On one occasion, at the time of
day when they were usually at work in the fields, he heard the sound of
persons entering the house, and turned and slew them, and only found
afterwards that it was his parents whose lives he had taken.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6370src" href="#xd21e6370" name="xd21e6370src">5</a>
Struck with horror he devoted himself to a life of penance, and made a
vow to live so far from the habitations of men that he should no more
hear the cheerful crowing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href=
"#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>of the cock or the holy chime of
the church bells. After his death the people found that angels had
planted roses on his grave which bloomed in winter, and they observed
that no venomous reptile ever rested on it, while earth taken from it
cured their sting. So they built a chapel in his honour on the border
of the little lake which bears his name, at the opening of Val
G&eacute;nova. Another interesting church in the same locality is that
of Caresolo. Its exterior walls are adorned with frescoes bearing date
1519, and inside is an inscription recording that it was restored by
the munificence of Charles Quint. At Pelugo, near Tione, where the
Rendenathal branches off, he found the castle in possession of a Jew,
and so indignant was he to find a once Christian fortress so occupied,
that he had him immediately ejected and the place exorcised. Here, as
also at Massimeno and Caderzone, all inconsiderable mountain villages,
new churches were consecrated during the Bishop of Trent&rsquo;s
visitation in August 1869, showing that the spirit of S. Vigilius had
not died out. In the Pfarrkirche at Condino is a <i lang=
"de"><span class="corr" id="xd21e6382" title=
"Source: Muttergottsesbild">Muttergottesbild</span></i>, presented in
1620 by a parishioner who averred he had seen it shed tears. Of the
church of Campiglio the legend runs, that when it was building, the
people being much distressed by a dearth, and their means hardly
sufficing, the angels used to bring stone, wood, and other materials in
the night; and one pillar is pointed out which was raised before the
eyes of the builders in broad day by invisible hands. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name="pb406">406</a>]</span>inn
here occupies a hospice built by the Templars, hence its imposing
appearance. Colini, who was locally called the Hofer of
W&auml;lsch-Tirol, for his brave leadership of his countrymen in
&lsquo;the year nine,&rsquo; kept it till his death in 1862. At Pinzolo
is a thriving glass-house, supported by Milanese capital and Venetian
art and industry.</p>
<p>Riva, at the head of the Garda-See, is one of the most charming
spots in Tirol. Its German name of <i lang="de">Reif</i> is not a mere
corruption of the Italian name; it is an old German word, having the
same signification, of a shore. The parish church is a really handsome
edifice, and a great ornament to the town and neighbourhood. Outside
the town is a curious octagonal church of the Immaculate Conception,
built to enclose a wonder-working picture of the Blessed Virgin, by
Cardinal Karl von Madruzz, who also founded a House of Friars Minor to
attend to the spiritual necessities of the many pilgrims who came to
visit it. The churches of S. Roch and S. Sebastian were built on
occasion of visitations of the plague in 1522 and 1633. The
neighbourhood supplies the whole of Tirol with twigs of olive to use in
the office of Palm Sunday, and all kinds of southern produce grow on
the banks of the lake. It was long considered the highest latitude at
which the olive-tree would grow, but it has since been successfully
cultivated as far north as Botzen. In order to gain a full enjoyment of
the beautiful scenery around, the Altissimo di Nago should be ascended
by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>all who have the courage for a six or seven
hours&rsquo; climb. From San Giacomo, however, where there is a poor
<i lang="de">Wirthshaus</i> and chapel, reached in not more than two
hours, the scene at sunrise is one of inconceivable beauty. Behind are
ranges beyond ranges and peaks beyond peaks of lordly alps. Before you
lies the blue Lago di Garda, and the vast Lombard plains studded with
fair cities, amid which you will not fail to distinguish Milan, which
some optical illusion brings so near that it seems it would take but an
easy morning&rsquo;s walk to reach it.</p>
<p>On the way hence to Mori, at about half distance, lies Brentonico,
with a new church perched picturesquely as a medi&aelig;val one on a
bold scarped rock. The old parish church has a fine crypt. The Castello
del Dosso Maggiore is a noble ruin. There is a bridge over a deep
defile in the outskirts, called the <i lang="it">Ponte delle
strege</i>&mdash;the Witches&rsquo; Bridge&mdash;being deemed too
daring for human builders. Mori, though named from its mulberry trees,
is more famed for its tobacco, which is reckoned the best grown in
Tirol.</p>
<p>W&auml;lsch-Tirol has many traditions, customs and sayings, which
differ from those of the rest of the Principality, more resembling
those of Italy, and some of which it cannot be fanciful to trace back
to an Etruscan connection. Some bear the impress of the Roman
occupation, and all are strung together by an overpowering Germanic
influence.</p>
<p>The most prominent group&mdash;and their special home, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span>I am
assured, clusters round the Dolomite mountains&mdash;are those
concerning certain beings called &lsquo;Salvan&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Gannes;&rsquo; and traditions about &lsquo;Orco.&rsquo; A local
collector of such lore, to whom I am chiefly indebted for the above
fact, is inclined to identify the &lsquo;Salvan&rsquo; with
&lsquo;Orco;&rsquo; but I think it can be shown that they are distinct
ideas. Both are only ordinarily, not always malicious, but the
&lsquo;Salvan&rsquo; is one of a number of sprites, Orco has the
dignity of being one by himself. The Salvan in some respects takes the
place of the wild man of the North, and of the satyr whom I also found
called in Rome &lsquo;salvatico&rsquo; and
&lsquo;selvaggio.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6408src" href=
"#xd21e6408" name="xd21e6408src">6</a> &lsquo;Orco&rsquo; clearly takes
the place of Orcus in Italy; and that of the &lsquo;Teufel&rsquo; in
German legend. Yet so are the traditions of neighbouring peoples
intermingled, that the Germans, not content with their own devil, have
sprightly imitations of Orco in their &lsquo;Nork&rsquo; and Lorg,
softened in the intermediate Deutsch Tirol into Norg.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6413src" href="#xd21e6413" name="xd21e6413src">7</a> In Norway
the same appellation is found, hardened into N&ouml;k, Neck,
Nikr,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6419src" href="#xd21e6419" name=
"xd21e6419src">8</a> which seems to bring us round to our own
&lsquo;Old Nick;&rsquo; for in Iceland he is &lsquo;Knikur,&rsquo; and,
perhaps, he gave his name to Orkney.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6425src" href="#xd21e6425" name="xd21e6425src">9</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name="pb409">409</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is curious, in tracing the seemingly undoubtable connection
between the Norg and Orco, to observe that though the Norg possesses
almost invincible strength, and often prevails against giants, yet in
stature he is always a dwarf, while Orco himself is considered a giant.
But then it is the one essential characteristic of Orco which forms the
link between all conceptions of him, whether men call him Orco, Nork,
or Nyk, that he is a deceiver ever; a liar from the beginning; whenever
he appears it is continually under some ever-changing,
not-to-be-expected form, and only the wise guess what he is before it
is too late.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6435src" href="#xd21e6435"
name="xd21e6435src">10</a> Thus it happened to two young lads of Mori,
who had been up the mountains to visit their sweet-hearts, and coming
back, they met Orco prowling about after his manner when all good
people are safe in bed asleep&mdash;this time in the form of an ass.
The Mori lads, never thinking but that it was a common ass, jumped on
its back. They soon found out their mistake, for Orco quickly resented
their want of discrimination, and cantered off with them past an old
building which had once been a prison, and skilfully chucked them both
in at the window. It was some days before they contrived to crawl out
again, and not till they were nearly starved. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name="pb410">410</a>]</span></p>
<p>But we have in English another affinity with &lsquo;Orco,&rsquo;
besides &lsquo;Old Nick;&rsquo; we have seen him take the place of our
&lsquo;ogre&rsquo; in deed as well as in name in the Roman fairy tales,
and in Italy he is also the bugbear of the nursery which we have almost
literally in &lsquo;Old Bogey.&rsquo; And now Mr. I. Taylor has found
another affinity for him if he be justified in identifying our
&lsquo;ogre&rsquo; with &ldquo;the Tatar word,
&lsquo;<i>ugry</i>,&rsquo; a thief.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6450src" href="#xd21e6450" name="xd21e6450src">11</a></p>
<p>To return to Orco&rsquo;s place in Tirol, we find his name assumes
nearly as many transliterations as his external appearance assumes
changes. In Vorarlberg they have a Dorgi or Doggi (i being the frequent
local abbreviation for the diminutive <i lang=
"de">lein</i>,&mdash;<i lang="de">klein</i>), there considered as one
personation of the devil. The Doggi spreads over part of Switzerland,
and overflows into Alsace as the Doggele.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6464src" href="#xd21e6464" name="xd21e6464src">12</a> In the zone
of Tirol where the Italian and German elements of the population
mingle, there is a class of mischievous irrepressible elfs called
Orgen; soft, and round, and small, like cats without head or feet, who
establish themselves in any part of a house performing all sorts of
annoyances, but who are as afraid of egg-shells as the Norgs in other
parts are said to be. Their chief home is in the Martelthal, south of
Schlanders in the Vintschgau, and their name is devoted to the brightly
shining peak seen from it&mdash;the Orgelspitz. In the Passeyer, on the
north side of the Vintschgau, they go by the name of Oerkelen.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name=
"pb411">411</a>]</span></p>
<p>Since we have seen him, too, divested of his &lsquo;r&rsquo; in
Doggi from Vorarlberg to Alsace, and the Germans have already given him
an L in Lorg, he assumes a mysterious likeness to Loki himself, and as
a sample of how elastic is language, and how misleading are mere
sounds, though for no other purpose, it might be said, we had found in
this Doggi a relation of the dog who guards the entrance to the regions
of Orcus!</p>
<p>The Salvan and Gannes, as described by the local observer above
alluded to, seem to partake very much of the character of the good and
evil genii of the Etruscans, though the traditions that remain of them
refer almost exclusively to their action on this side the grave.
&lsquo;Their Etruscan appellation,&rsquo; says Mr. Dennis, &lsquo;is
not yet discovered;&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6475src" href=
"#xd21e6475" name="xd21e6475src">13</a> when it is, it will be very
satisfactory if it has any analogy with &lsquo;Gannes.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6482src" href="#xd21e6482" name=
"xd21e6482src">14</a> The Gannes were gentle, beauteous, beneficent
beings, delighting in being helpful to those they took under their
protection; harmful to none. The Salvans were hideous, wild, and
fierce, delighting in mischief and destruction, with fiery serpents for
their chief companions. They seem to have done all the mischief they
could as long as their sway lasted, but they were scared by advancing
civilization; and I have a ludicrous <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb412" href="#pb412" name="pb412">412</a>]</span>description of how
they stood gazing down in stupid wonderment from their Dolomite peaks,
when the first ploughs were brought into use in the valleys.</p>
<p>Schneller, who with all his appreciation of W&auml;lsch-Tirol, looks
at its traditions too much through German spectacles, gives us some
little account of these beings too.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6495src"
href="#xd21e6495" name="xd21e6495src">15</a></p>
<p>He has also a &lsquo;Salvanel,&rsquo; who seems a male counterpart
of his Gannes, helpful and soft-natured, with no vice save a tendency
to steal milk. In return he teaches mankind to make butter and cheese,
and other useful arts, and is specially kind to little children; his
name bears some relation with the local word for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>&lsquo;Jack-&rsquo;o-lantern&rsquo; reflection
from glass or water. But he found also the &lsquo;Salvan&rsquo; in his
pernicious character under the names of &lsquo;Bedelmon,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Bildermon,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Salvadegh.&rsquo; But the most
pernicious spirit that came in his way was the &lsquo;Beatrik,&rsquo;
who is an unmitigated fury,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6505src" href=
"#xd21e6505" name="xd21e6505src">16</a> and the natural enemy and
antagonist of a gentle, helpful, beauteous spirit called Angane,
Eguane, and Enguane, but possessed with his German ideas, he saw in the
being so designated nothing but &lsquo;a witch, or perhaps a
fairy-natured being.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6511src" href=
"#xd21e6511" name="xd21e6511src">17</a> In another page he pairs them
off more fairly with the &lsquo;S&auml;ligen Fr&auml;ulein&rsquo; of
Germany. Here is a story of their ways which was given me, but I do not
know if it was founded on his at page 215, or independently
collected:&mdash;A young woodman was surprised one day to meet, in the
midst of his lonely toil, a beautiful maiden, who nodded to him
familiarly, and bid him &lsquo;good day&rsquo; with more than common
interest. Nor did her conversation end with &lsquo;good day;&rsquo; she
found enough to prattle about till night fell; and then, though the
young woodman had been sitting by her side instead of attending to his
work, he found he had a bigger faggot to carry home than he had ever
made up with all his day&rsquo;s labour before. &lsquo;That was a sweet
maiden, indeed,&rsquo; he mused on his way home. &lsquo;And yet I doubt
if she is all right. But her talk showed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb414" href="#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>she was of the right
stuff to make a housewife; but then Maddalena, what will she say? ha!
let her say what she will, she won&rsquo;t stand comparing with her! I
wonder if I shall see her again! And yet I don&rsquo;t think
she&rsquo;s altogether right, either.&rsquo; So he mused all through
the lonely evening, and all through the sleepless night; and his first
thought in the morning was of whether he should meet that strange
maiden again in the wood. In the wood he did meet her, and again she
wiled away the day with her prattle; and again and again they met.
Maddalena sat at home weeping over her spinning-wheel, and wondering
why he came no more to take her for a walk; but Maddalena was
forgotten, and one day it was her fate to see her former lover and the
strange maiden married in the parish church. The woodman was not
surprised to find his seiren the model of a wife. The house was swept
so clean, the clothes so neatly mended, the butter so quickly churned,
that though all the villagers had been shy of the strange maiden, none
could deny her excellent capacity. The woodman was very well satisfied
with his choice; but as he had always a misgiving that there was
something not quite right with her, he could not help nervously
watching every little peculiarity. It was thus he came to notice that
it was occasionally her custom to lay her long wavy tresses carefully
outside the bedclothes at night; he thought this odd, and determined to
watch her. One night, when she thought him asleep, and he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name="pb415">415</a>]</span>was
only feigning, he observed that she took a little box of salve from
under her pillow, and rubbing it into her hair, said, <i lang=
"it">Schiva boschi e schiva selva</i> (shun woods and forests), and
then was off and away in a trice. Determined to follow her, he took out
the box of salve, and rubbing it into his hair, tried to repeat her
saying, but he did not recall it precisely, and said instead, <i lang=
"it">Passa boschi e passa selvi</i> (away through woods and forests),
and away he went, faster than he liked, while his clothes and his skin
were torn by the branches of the trees. He came, however, to the
precincts of a great palace, where was a fresh green meadow, on which
were a number of kine grazing, and some were sleek and well-favoured,
while some were piteously lean; and yet they all fed on the same
pasture. The palace had so many windows that it took him a long while
to count them, and when he had counted them he found there were three
hundred and sixty-five. He climbed up and looked in at one of
them&mdash;it was the window of a great hall, where a number of
<i>Enguane</i> were dancing, and his wife in their midst. When he saw
her, he called out to her; but when she heard his voice, instead of
coming she took to flight, nor could he overtake her with all his
strength for running. At last, after pursuing her for three days, he
came to the hut of a holy hermit, who asked him wherefore he ran so
fast; and when he had told him, the hermit bid him give up the chase,
for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span>an Enguane was not a proper wife for a Christian
man. Then the woodman asked him to let him become a hermit too, and
pass the remainder of his life under his guidance. To this the hermit
consented; so he built him a house, and they lived together in holy
contemplation. One day the woodman told the hermit of what he had seen
when he went forth to seek his wife; and the hermit told him that the
palace with three hundred and sixty-five windows represented this
temporal world, with its years of three hundred and sixty-five days;
but the fresh green meadow was the Church, in which the Redeemer gave
His Flesh for the food of all alike; but that while some pastured on it
to the gain of their eternal salvation, who were represented by the
well-favoured kine, there were also the perverse and sinful, who eat to
their own condemnation, and were represented by the lean and distressed
kine.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6530src" href="#xd21e6530" name=

<p>It is less easy to collect local traditions in W&auml;lsch-Tirol
than in any other part of the principality, but legends and marvellous
stories exist in abundance; and so long as the institution of the
<i>Fil&ograve;</i> (or out-house room where village gossips meet to
spend their evenings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417"

last, they will not be allowed to die out:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6540src" href="#xd21e6540" name="xd21e6540src">19</a> it is said
that there are some old ladies who can go on retailing stories <i>by
the week</i> together! And though by the nature of the case these
gatherings must consist almost exclusively of women, yet it is thought
uncanny not to have any man about the place; in fact, that in such a
case <i>Froberte</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e6557src" href=

exclaimed, &lsquo;Only see! we have no man at all among us; let&rsquo;s
be off, or something will happen!&rsquo; All rose to make their escape
at the warning, but before they had time to leave, a <i lang="it">donna

propitiate her by politeness; and the nearest offered her a chair.
&lsquo;Wait a little, and you&rsquo;ll see another with a longer nose

second <i lang="it">donna Berta</i> knocked and entered, to whom the
women gave the same greeting. &lsquo;Wait a bit, and you&rsquo;ll see
another with a longer nose than I,&rsquo; said the second <i lang=

Then the first said, &lsquo;What shall we be at?&rsquo; To which the
second made answer, &lsquo;Suppose we do a bit of washing:&rsquo; and
the others agreeing, they told the women to give them pails to fetch
water with; but the women, knowing that their intention was to have
suffocated them all in the wash-tubs, gave them baskets instead. Not
noticing the trick, they went down to the Etsch with the baskets to
fetch water, and when they found that all their labour was in vain,
they ran back in a great fury; but in the meantime the women had all
escaped to their home, and every one was safe in bed with her husband.
But a <span class="corr" id="xd21e6587" title=

cried, &lsquo;It is well for you you have taken refuge with your
husband!&rsquo; The next night the women were determined to pay off the
<i lang="it">brava Berta</i> for the fright they had had, so they got
one of their husbands to hide himself in the crib of the oxen; had he
sat down with them, the Froberte would not have come at all. Not seeing
him, Froberte knocked and came in, and they greeted her and gave her a
chair, just as on the previous night; and the whole twelve soon
arrived. Before they could begin their washing operations, however, the
man sprang out of the crib, and put them to flight with many hard
blows; so that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>they did not return for many a long day. The
last day of Carneval was called <i lang="it">il giorno delle
Froberte</i>, probably because many wild pranks in which sober people
allow themselves to indulge on that day of licence were laid on the
shoulders of Mistress Bertha. But it is also said, that since the
sitting of the Holy Council of Trent, the power for mischief of these
elves has grown quite insignificant. Here are some few specimens of the
multifarious stories of the <i>Fil&ograve;</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6602src" href="#xd21e6602" name="xd21e6602src">22</a> Once there
was a man and his wife who had two daughters: one pretty, but vain and
malicious; the other ugly, but docile and pious. The mother made a
favourite of the pretty daughter, but set the ugly one to do all the
work of the house; and though she worked from morning to night, was
never satisfied with her. One day she sent her down to the stream to do
the washing; but the stream was swollen with the heavy rains, and had
become so rapid that it carried off her sister&rsquo;s shift. Not
daring to go home without it, she ran by the side of the stream, trying
to fetch it back. All her pains were vain; the stream went on tumbling
and roaring till it swelled out into a big river, and she could no
longer even distinguish the shift from the white foam on which it was
borne along. At last, hungry and weary, she descried a house, where she
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name=
"pb420">420</a>]</span>knocked with a trembling hand, and begged for
shelter. The good woman come to the door, but advised her not to
venture in, for the <i>Salvan</i> would soon be home; but the child
knew nothing about the <i>Salvan</i>, but a great deal about the storm,
and as one was brooding, and night coming on, she crept in. She had not
been long inside, when the <i>Salvan</i> came home, also seeking
shelter from the storm. &lsquo;What stink is this I smell of Christian
flesh?&rsquo; he roared; and the child was too truthful to remained
concealed, and so came forward and told all her tale. The <i>Salvan</i>
was won by her artlessness, and not only allowed her a bed and a
supper, but gave her a basketful of as much fine linen as she could
carry, to make up for her loss. When her pretty sister saw what a
quantity of fine linen the <i>Salvan</i> had given her, she determined
to go and beg for some too; but when the <i>Salvan</i> saw her coming,
he holloaed out, &lsquo;So you&rsquo;re the child who behaves so ill to
your sister!&rsquo; and he gave her such a rude drubbing, that she went
back with very few clothes on that were not in rags.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>In selecting a specimen or two of the <i lang="it">fiabe</i> I will
take first a group going by the name of &lsquo;Zuam&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Gian dall&rsquo; Orso&rsquo; (Bear-Johnny),<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6637src" href="#xd21e6637" name="xd21e6637src">23</a> because
the Wolf-boy group is a very curious one, and this is our nearest
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span>approach to it,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6642src" href="#xd21e6642" name="xd21e6642src">24</a> though it
deals with a bear-child and not a wolf-child;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6645src" href="#xd21e6645" name="xd21e6645src">25</a> and because
we have already found Orso and Orco confounded in Italian folk-lore at
Rome. The following is from Val di Non:&mdash;A labourer and his wife
had their little boy out with them as they worked in the fields. A
she-bear came out of the woods and carried him off. She treated him
well, however, and taught him to be strong and hardy, and when he was
twenty years old she sent him to his parents. He had such an appetite
that he eat them out of house and home, and then he made his mother go
and beg all over the country till she had enough to buy him three
hundredweight of iron to make him a club. Armed with this club, he went
forth to seek fortune. In the woods he met a giant carrying a leaden
club called <i lang="it">Barbiscat</i> (&lsquo;Cat&rsquo;s
Beard&rsquo;), and the two made friends went out together till they met
another giant, who carried a wooden club called <i lang="it">Testa di
Molton</i> (&lsquo;Ram&rsquo;s Head&rsquo;). They made friends and went
out together till they came to a house in a town where magicians lived.
The giant with Barbiscat knocked first, and at midnight a magician came
out and said, &lsquo;Earthworm, wherefore are you come?&rsquo; then he
of Barbiscat was frightened and ran away. The next night the giant with
<i lang="it">Testa di Molton</i> knocked with the same result. But the
third night Gian dall&rsquo; Orso himself knocked, and he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name="pb422">422</a>]</span>had
no fear, but when the magician came out he knocked him down with many
blows of his iron club, and went to fetch the other two giants. When
they returned no magician was to be seen, only a trail of blood. They
followed the trail till they came to a deep pit, and Zuam dall&rsquo;
Orso made the giants let him down by a rope. In a cave he found the
wounded magician and three others besides, by slaying whom he delivered
a beautiful maiden. The giants drew her up, but abandoned him. Then he
saw a ring lying on the ground, and when he took it up and rubbed it
two Moors appeared and asked him what he wanted. &lsquo;I want an
eagle, to bear me up to earth,&rsquo; he said. So they brought him a
big eagle, &lsquo;but,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;he must be well fed the
while.&rsquo; So he bid them bring him two shins of beef, and fed him
well the while, and the eagle bore him to the king; who finding he was
the deliverer of his daughter, killed the two giants, and gave him
plenty of gold and silver, with which he went back to his home and
lived happily and in peace,&mdash;a very homely termination, welcome to
the mountaineer&rsquo;s mind. In the Lederthal version he was so strong
at two years old that he lifted up the mountain under which the
bear&rsquo;s den was, and ran back to his mother; but at school he
killed all the children, and knocked down the teacher and the priest,
and was sent to prison. Here he lifted the door off its hinges, and
went to the judge, and made him give him a sword, with which he went
forth to seek fortune. With the two companions picked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name="pb423">423</a>]</span>up
by the wayside, who for once do not play him the trick of leaving him
below in the cave, he delivers three princesses, and all are made
happy. In another version, where he is called &lsquo;Filomusso the
Smith,&rsquo; and is nurtured by an ass instead of a bear, the
provision of meat for feeding the eagle is exhausted before he reaches
the earth, and he heroically tears a piece of flesh out of his own leg,
and thus the flight can be completed.</p>
<p>2. The following version of the story of Joseph and his Brethren is
quaint:&mdash;A king had three sons. The two elder were grown up, while
Jacob (the Italian is not given) was still quite small, and was his
father&rsquo;s pet. One day, when the king came back from hunting, he
was quite out of sorts because he had lost the feather (<span lang=
"it">la penna dell&rsquo; uccello sgrifone</span>) he was wont always
to wear. When everyone had sought for it in vain, little Jacob came to
him, and bid him eat and be of good cheer for he and his brothers would
find the feather. The king promises his kingdom to whichever of the
three finds it. Little Jacob finds the feather, and carries it full of
joy to his brothers. The brothers, jealous that he should have the
kingdom, kill him and take the feather to their father. A year after a
shepherd finds little Jacob&rsquo;s bones, and takes one of them to
make a fife, but as soon as he begins to play upon it the fife tells
the whole story of the foul play. The shepherd takes it to the king,
who convicts his two sons, has them put to death, and dies of grief.

<p>3. Here is a homely version of Oidipous and the Sphinx:&mdash;A poor
man owed a large debt and had nothing to pay it with. The rich man to
whom he owed it came to demand the sum, and found only the poor
man&rsquo;s little boy sitting by the hearth. &lsquo;What are you
doing?&rsquo; asked the rich man. &lsquo;I watch them come and
go,&rsquo; replied the boy. &lsquo;Do so many people come to you
then?&rsquo; enquired the rich man. &lsquo;No man,&rsquo; replied the
boy. Not liking to own himself puzzled, the rich man asked again,
&lsquo;Where is your father?&rsquo; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone to plug a
hole with another hole,&rsquo; replied the boy. Posed again, the rich
man proceeded, &lsquo;And where&rsquo;s your mother?&rsquo;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s baking bread that&rsquo;s already eaten,&rsquo;
replied the boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are either very clever or a great idiot,&rsquo; now
retorted the rich man; &lsquo;will you please to explain
yourself?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, if you will reward me by forgiving father
his debt.&rsquo; The rich man accepted the terms, and the boy
proceeded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m boiling beans, and the bubbling water makes them
seethe, and I watch them come and go. My father is gone to borrow a sum
of money to pay you with, so to plug one hole he is making another. All
the bread we have eaten for a fortnight past was borrowed of a
neighbour, now mother is making some to pay it back with, so I may well
say what she is making is already eaten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rich man expressed himself satisfied, and the poor man was
delivered from the burden of his debt.</p>
<p>4. A poor country lad once went out into the wide <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>world to seek fortune. As he went along he met a
very old woman carrying a pail of water, with which she seemed sadly
overladen. The poor lad ran after her, and carried it home for her. But
she was an Angana, and to reward him she gave him a dog and a cat, and
a little silver ring, which she told him to turn round whenever he was
in difficulty. The boy walked on, thinking little about the old
woman&rsquo;s ring, and not at all believing in its efficacy. When he
got tired with his walking he laid down under a tree, but he was too
hungry to sleep. As he lay tossing about he twirled the ring round
without knowing what he was doing, and suddenly an old woman appeared
before him, just like the one he had helped, and asked what he wanted
of her. &lsquo;Something to eat and drink<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e6684" title="Not in source">,</span>&rsquo; was the ready and
natural answer. He had hardly spoken it when he found a table spread
with good things before him. He made a good meal, nor did he neglect to
feed his dog and cat well; and then they all had a good sleep. In the
morning he reasoned, &lsquo;Why should I journey further when my ring
can give one all one wants?&rsquo; So he turned the ring round; and
when the old woman appeared he asked for a house, and meadows, and
farming-stock, and furniture; and then he paused to think of what more
he could possibly desire; but he remembered the lessons of moderation
his mother had taught him, and he said, &lsquo;No, it is not good for a
man to have all he wants in this world.&rsquo; So he asked for nothing
more, but set to work to cultivate his land. One day when he was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name=
"pb426">426</a>]</span>working on his land, a grand damsel came by with
a number of servants riding after her. The damsel had lost her way, and
had to ask him to lead her back to the right path. As they went, she
talked to him about his house and his means, and his way of life; and
before she had got to her journey&rsquo;s end they were so well pleased
with each other that she agreed to go back with him and marry him; but
it was the ring she was in love with rather than with him. They were no
sooner married than she got possession of the ring, and by its power
she ordered the farm-house to be changed into a palace, and the
farm-servants into liveried retainers, and all manner of luxuries, and
chests of coin. Nor was she satisfied with this. One day, when her
husband was asleep in a summer-house, she ordered it to be carried up
to the highest tip of a very high mountain, and the palace far away
into her own country. When he woke he found himself all alone on the
frightful height, with no one but the dog and cat, who always slept the
one at his head and the other at his feet. Though he was an expert
climber it was impossible to get down from so sharp a peak, so he sat
down and gave himself up to despair. The cat and dog, however,
comforted him, and said they would provide the remedy. They clambered
down the rugged declivity, and ran on together till they came to a
stream which puss could not cross, but the dog put her on his back and
swam over with her; and without further adventure they made their way
to the palace where their master&rsquo;s wife lived. With some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>cleverness they man&oelig;uvred their way into
the interior, but into the bed-room there seemed no chance of effecting
an entrance. They paced up and down hour by hour, but the door was
never opened. At last, when all was very still, a mouse came running
along the corridor. The cat pounced on the mouse, who pleaded hard for
mercy in favour of her seven small children. &lsquo;If I restore you to
liberty,&rsquo; said the cat, &lsquo;you must do something for me in
return.&rsquo; The mouse promised everything; and the cat instructed
her to gnaw a hole in the door, and fetch the ring out of the
princess&rsquo;s mouth, where she made no doubt she kept it at night
for safety. The mouse kept her word, and obeying her directions
punctually, soon returned with the ring; and off the cat and dog set on
their return home, in high glee at their success. It rankled, however,
in the dog&rsquo;s mind, that it was the cat who had all the glory of
recovering the treasure; and by the time they had got back to the
stream he told her that if she would not give him the satisfaction of
carrying the ring the rest of the way, he would not carry her over it.
The cat would not accept his view, and a fight ensued, in the midst of
which the ring escaped them both and fell into the water, where it was
caught by a fish. The cat was in despair, but the dog plunged in and
seized the fish, and by regaining the ring earned equal right to the
merit of its recovery, and they clambered together in amity. Their
master was rejoiced to receive his ring once more, and by its power he
got back his homestead and farm-stock, and sent for his mother to live
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name=
"pb428">428</a>]</span>him, and all his life through took great care of
his faithful dog and cat; but the perverse princess he ordered the ring
to transfer in the summer-house to the peak whither she would have
banished him. When all this was set in order he threw away the ring,
because he said it was not well for a man to have all his wishes
satisfied in this world.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6694src" href=
"#xd21e6694" name="xd21e6694src">26</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>The following legend of St. K&uuml;mmerniss is very popular in
Tirol. Churchill, in his &lsquo;Titian&rsquo;s Country,&rsquo; mentions
a chapel on the borders of Cadore and W&auml;lsch-Tirol, where she is
represented just as there described, but he does not appear to have
inquired into its symbolism. There was once a heathen king who had a
daughter named K&uuml;mmerniss, who was fair and beautiful beyond
compare. A neighbouring king, also a heathen, sought her in marriage,
and her father gave his consent to the union; but K&uuml;mmerniss was
distressed beyond measure, for she had vowed in her own heart to be the
bride of heaven. Of course her father could not understand her motives,
and to force her to marry put her into a hard prison. From the depths
of the dungeon K&uuml;mmerniss prayed that she might be so transformed
that no man should wish to marry her; and in conformity with her
devoted petition, when they came to take her out of the prison they
found that all her beauty was gone, and her face overgrown with long
hair like a man&rsquo;s beard. When her father saw the change in her he
was indignant, and asked what had befallen her. She replied that He
whom she adored had changed her so, to save her from marrying the
heathen king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name=
"pb430">430</a>]</span>after she had vowed herself to be His bride
alone. &lsquo;Then shall you die, like Him you adore,&rsquo; was her
father&rsquo;s answer. She meekly replied that she had no greater
desire than to die, that she might be united with Him. And thus her
pure life was taken a sweet sacrifice; and whoso would like her be
altogether devoted to God, and like her obtain their petition from
heaven, let them honour her, and cause her effigy to be painted in the
church. So many believed they found the efficacy of her intercession,
that they set up memorial images of her everywhere, and in one place
they set one up all in pure gold. A poor minstrel once came by that way
with his violin; and because he had earned nothing, and was near
starving, he stood before St. K&uuml;mmerniss and played his prayer on
his violin. Plaintive and more plaintive still grew his beseeching
notes, till at last the saint, who never sent any away empty, shook off
one of her golden shoes, and bid him take it for an alms. The minstrel
carried the golden shoe to a goldsmith, and asked him to buy it of him
for money; but the goldsmith, recognizing whence it came, refused to
have anything to do with sacrilegious traffic, and accused him of
stealing it. The minstrel loudly protested his innocence, and the
goldsmith as loudly vociferated his accusation, till their clamour
raised the whole village; and all were full of fury and indignation at
the supposed crime of the minstrel. As their anger grew, they were near
tearing him in pieces, when a grave hermit came by, and they asked him
to judge the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>case. &lsquo;If it be true that the man obtained
one shoe by his minstrelsy, let him play till he obtain the other in
our sight,&rsquo; was his sentence; and all the people were so pleased
with it, that they dragged the minstrel back to the shrine of St.
K&uuml;mmerniss. The minstrel, who had been as much astonished as
anyone else at his first success, scarcely dared hope for a second, but
it was death to shrink from the test; so he rested his instrument on
his shoulder, and drew the bow across it with trembling hand. Sweet and
plaintive were the shuddering voice-like tones he sent forth before the
shrine; but yet the second shoe fell not. The people began to murmur;
horror heightened his distress. Cadence after cadence, moan upon moan,
wail upon wail, faltered through the air, and entranced every ear and
palsied every hand that would have seized him; till at last, overcome
with the intensity of his own passionate appeal, the minstrel sank
unconscious on the ground. When they went to raise him up, they found
that the second golden shoe was no longer on the saint&rsquo;s foot,
but that she had cast it towards him. When they saw that, each vied
with the other to make amends for the unjust suspicions of the past.
The golden shoes were restored to the saint; but the minstrel never
wanted for good entertainment for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Puss in Boots&rsquo; figures in the Folklore of
W&auml;lsch-Tirol as &lsquo;<span lang="it">Il Conte Martin della
Gatta</span>;&rsquo; its chief point of variation is that no boots
enter into it at all, otherwise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432"
href="#pb432" name="pb432">432</a>]</span>the action of the cat is as
usual in other versions.</p>
<p>There is another class of stories in which the townspeople indulge
at the expense of the uninstructed peasants in outlying districts, and
which their extreme simplicity and na&iuml;vet&eacute; occasionally
justify. I must not close my notice of the Volklore of
W&auml;lsch-Tirol without giving some specimens of these. It may be
generally observed that stories which have no particular moral point,
and are designed only to amuse without instructing, are as frequent in
the Trentino as they are rare in the German divisions of Tirol.</p>
<p>Turlul&ugrave;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6733src" href="#xd21e6733"
name="xd21e6733src">27</a> was such a simple boy that he could not be
made to do anything aright; and what was worst was, he thought himself
so clever that he would always go off without listening to half his
instructions. One day his mother sent him with her last piece of money
to buy a bit of meat for a poor neighbour; &lsquo;And mind,&rsquo; she
said, &lsquo;that the butcher doesn&rsquo;t give you all bone.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Leave that to me!&rsquo; cried Turlul&ugrave; without waiting
for an explanation; and off he went to the town. The butcher offered
him a nice piece of leg of beef. &lsquo;No, no, there&rsquo;s bone to
that,&rsquo; cried Turlul&ugrave;; &lsquo;that won&rsquo;t do.&rsquo;
The butcher, provoked, offered him a lump of lights. Turlul&ugrave;
seeing it look so soft, and no bone at all to it, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433" name="pb433">433</a>]</span>went
off with it quite pleased, but of course the poor neighbour had to
starve. When his mother found what he had done, she was in great
distress, for she had no money left; so she sent him with a piece of
home-spun linen to try to sell it. &lsquo;But mind you don&rsquo;t
waste your time talking to gossiping old women,&rsquo; she said.
&lsquo;Leave that to me, mother,&rsquo; cried Turlul&ugrave;; and off
he ran. As he got near the market-place, he began crying, &lsquo;Fine
linen! who wants to buy fine linen!&rsquo; Several countrywomen, who
had come up to town to make purchases, came to look at the quality.
&lsquo;Go along, you gossiping old things; don&rsquo;t imagine
I&rsquo;m going to sell it to you!&rsquo; cried Turlul&ugrave;, and he
ran away from them. As he ran on he saw a <i lang=
"it">capitello</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e6755src" href=
"#xd21e6755" name="xd21e6755src">28</a> by the wayside. When he saw the
image of the Blessed Virgin, looking so grave and calm, he said,
&lsquo;Ah, you are no gossip, you shall have my linen;&rsquo; and he
threw it at her feet. &lsquo;Come, pay me!&rsquo; he cried presently;
but of course the figure moved not. &lsquo;Ah, I see, you&rsquo;ve not
got the money to-day; I will come back for it to-morrow.&rsquo; When he
came back on the morrow the linen had been picked up by a passer-by,
but no money was forthcoming. &lsquo;Pay me now,&rsquo; said
Turlul&ugrave;; but still the figure was immovable. Again and again he
repeated the demand, till, finding it still unheeded, he took off his
belt, and hit hard and fast upon the image. So great was his violence,
that in a very short time he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href=
"#pb434" name="pb434">434</a>]</span>had knocked it to the ground; and
lo and behold, inside the now uncovered pedestal were a heap of gold
pieces, which some miser had concealed there for greater security.
&lsquo;My mother herself will own this is good pay for the
linen,&rsquo; cried Turlul&ugrave;, as he filled his pockets,
&lsquo;and for once she won&rsquo;t find fault.&rsquo; His way home lay
along the edge of the pond, and as he passed the ducks were crying,
&lsquo;Quack! quack! quack!&rsquo; Turlul&ugrave; thought they were
saying <i lang="it">Quattro</i>, meaning that he had four pieces of
gold. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all you know about it,&rsquo; cried
Turlul&ugrave;; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got many more than four, many
more.&rsquo; But the ducks continued to cry &lsquo;Quack.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I tell you there are more than four,&rsquo; reiterated
Turlul&ugrave; impetuously, but the ducks did not alter their strain.
&lsquo;Then take them, and count them yourselves, and you&rsquo;ll see
what a lot there are!&rsquo; So saying, he threw the whole treasure
into the mud; and as the ducks, scared by the noise, left off their
&lsquo;quack,&rsquo; he satisfied himself that he had convinced them,
and went home to boast to his mother of the feat.</p>
<p>A showman came through a village with a dancing-bear. The people
went out to see him, and gave him plenty of halfpence. &lsquo;Suppose
we try our luck, and go about showing a bear too; it seems a profitable
sort of trade,&rsquo; said one of the lookers-on to another. &lsquo;Ay,
but where shall we find one?&rsquo; objected the man addressed.
&lsquo;Oh, there must be bears to be found; it needs only to go out and
look for them.&rsquo; They went out to look for a bear, and at last
really found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=
"pb435">435</a>]</span>one,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6772src" href=
"#xd21e6772" name="xd21e6772src">29</a> which ran before them and
plunged into a cave. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll
do,&rsquo; said the peasant who had proposed the adventure,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll creep into the cave and seize the bear, and you take
hold of my legs and pull us both out together.&rsquo; The other
assented; and in went the first. But the bear, instead of letting him
seize it, bit off his head. The other pulled him out as agreed, but was
much astonished to find him headless. &lsquo;Well, to be sure!&rsquo;
he cried, &lsquo;I never noticed the poor fellow came out this morning
without his head. I must go home and ask his wife for it.&rsquo; So
saying, he ran back to the man&rsquo;s house. &lsquo;I say,
neighbour,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;did you happen to notice, when your
husband went out this morning, whether he had his head on?&rsquo;
&lsquo;I never thought to look,<span class="corr" id="xd21e6775" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> replied the wife, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll
run up and see if he left it in bed; but tell me,&rsquo; she added,
&lsquo;will he catch cold for going out without his head on?&rsquo;
<span class="corr" id="xd21e6778" title="Not in source">&lsquo;</span>I
don&rsquo;t know as to that,&rsquo; replied the man; &lsquo;but if he
should want to whistle he might find it awkward!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A woman working in the fields one day saw a snail, which spread out
its horns as she looked at it. In great alarm, she ran to the chief man
of the parish, and told him what she had seen. He, too, was horribly
frightened, but he mastered his fear, as became the dignity of his
office. In order to provide duly for the safety of his village, he sent
two trustworthy men <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436"
name="pb436">436</a>]</span>with a large sum of money to Trent, to buy
a sharp sword; and till their return placed all the able-bodied men on
guard. When the man brought the sharp sword back from Trent, he called
the heads of the Commune together, and said to them: &lsquo;I will not
exercise my right of sending any of you in peril of his life, but I ask
you which of you is ready to encounter this great danger, and whoever
has the courage shall receive a great reward.&rsquo; Hereupon two of
the most valiant came forward as volunteers, and were invested with the
sharp sword. In solemn silence they marched boldly to the field where
the snail was, and they saw him sitting on the edge of a rotten leaf;
but at the moment when they had screwed up their courage to smite him
with the edge of the sword, the breeze blew down the leaf and the snail
with it. They, however, thought the snail was preparing to attack them,
and ran away so fast that they tumbled over the edge of an abyss.</p>
<p>The people of a certain village were envious because the church
tower of the neighbouring village was higher than theirs. So they held
a council to consider what remedy they could apply. No one could think
of anything to propose, till the oldest and wisest of them at last rose
and advised that a great heap of hay should be laid by the side of
their tower, so that it might eat and grow strong, and increase in
height. The counsel was received with applause, and every one
cheerfully brought his quota to the common sacrifice, till there
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=
"pb437">437</a>]</span>was a mighty heap of hay laid at the base of the
church tower. All the horses and asses that went by, finding such a
fine provision of provender laid out for them, ate the hay; but the
people seeing the heap diminish, were quite satisfied, and said,
&lsquo;Our tower must be beginning to grow, you see how fast it
eats!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In W&auml;lsch-Tirol the graves are not decked with flowers on All
Souls&rsquo; Day, as in Germany, but on the other hand it is customary
for the parish clergy to gather their flocks round them, and say the
Rosary kneeling amid the graves. Doles of bread, locally called
<i lang="it">cuzza</i>, and alms, are given away to the poor on that
day, and in some places a particular soup made of beans. The symbolism
was formerly carried so far, that these alms, devoted to the
refreshment of the souls of the departed, were actually laid on the
graves, as if it was supposed that the holy souls would come out and
partake of the material food. And thus some even placed vessels of cold
water as a special means of solace from their purgatorial
pains.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6794src" href="#xd21e6794" name=

<p>In Val Arsa, part of the loaves baked on Christmas Eve are kept, as
Cross-buns used to be among us. In Folgareit they have a curious game
for Christmas-tide. A number of heaps of flour, according to the number
of the household, are arranged on the table by the father of the
family, some little present being covered up in each; when they are
thus prepared the family is admitted, and the choice of places decided
by various modes of contest. In several parts, particularly in the
Rabbithal, the Lombard<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6809src" href=
"#xd21e6809" name="xd21e6809src">31</a> custom prevails of putting a
huge log on the fire, called the <i lang="it">Zocco di Natale</i> and
the <i lang="it">Zocco di ogni bene</i>, that it may burn all night and
keep the Divine Infant from the cold. The idea, more or less prevalent
all over Christendom, that beasts have the gift of speech on Christmas
Eve, prevails here no less. A story is told of a peasant who determined
to sit up and listen to what his oxen said. &lsquo;Where shall we have
to go to-morrow?&rsquo; he heard one say. &lsquo;We shall have to fetch
the boards for our master&rsquo;s coffin,&rsquo; replied his companion.
The man was so shocked, that he went to bed and died next day. Animals
are blessed on St. Anthony&rsquo;s day (January 18), as in Rome.</p>
<p>Carnival is celebrated with representations partaking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=
"pb439">439</a>]</span>somewhat of the character of &lsquo;Passion
Plays,&rsquo; though always with more or less humorous treatment of
their subject. Till lately there lingered a curious pastime at this
season, in which on Gioved&igrave; grasso there was a contest,
according to fixed rules, between the masked and unmasked inhabitants,
for certain cakes (<i lang="it">gnocchi</i>) made of Indian corn,
whence the day is still called <i lang="it">Gioved&igrave; dei
gnocchi</i>. It commemorated a fight between the men of Trent and them
of Feltre, who tried to carry off their provision while they were
building the walls of Trent, in the time of Theodoric King of the
Visigoths. S. Urban is considered the patron of vineyards in Etschland,
and on his feast his images are hung with bunches of grapes.</p>
<p>Here are a few specimens of their popular sayings and customs. When
it thunders the children say, <i lang="it">Domeniddio va in
carozza</i>. The chirping of a cricket, instead of being reckoned a
lucky token, forebodes death. Sponsors are regarded a person&rsquo;s
nearest relations, and at their funeral they go as chief mourners
before all others. Marriages in May are avoided. The reason why the
bramble always creeps along, instead of growing erect, is, because once
a thorny bramble branch caught the hair of the Blessed Virgin; before
that it grew erect like other trees. Cockchafers are blind, because one
of them once flew into the Blessed Virgin&rsquo;s face and startled
her; before that they had sight. Swallows are called <i lang=
"it">uccelli della Madonna</i>, but I have not ascertained the reason.
Scorpions, which are venomous in Italy, are not so in the Italian
Tirol, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440" name=
"pb440">440</a>]</span>because one fell once into St. Vigilius&rsquo;
chalice at Mass. I will conclude with some popular riddles, showing a
traditionary observation of the movements of the heavenly bodies, but
not much humour:</p>

very disappointing that he has translated the great bulk of his vast
collection of fiabe (&lsquo;<i lang="it">fiaba</i>&rsquo; in North
Italian answers to the &lsquo;favola&rsquo; of Rome) so utterly into
German that, though we find all our old friends among them, all the
distinctive expressions are translated away, and they are rendered
valueless for all but mere childish amusement. Thus it is interesting
to find in W&auml;lsch-Tirol a diabolical counterpart of the Roman
story of &lsquo;Pret&rsquo; Olivo,&rsquo; but it would have rendered it
infinitely more interesting had the collector told us what was the word
which he translates by &lsquo;Teufel,&rsquo; for it is the rarest thing
in the world for an Italian to bring the personified
&lsquo;Diavolo&rsquo; or &lsquo;Demonio&rsquo; into any light story. In
the same way it is interesting to find all the other tales with which
we are familiar turn up here, but the real use of printing them at
length would have been to point out their characteristics. What was the
Italian used for the words rendered in the German by
&lsquo;Witch?&rsquo; Was it &lsquo;Gannes&rsquo; or
&lsquo;strega?&rsquo; or for &lsquo;Giant&rsquo; and &lsquo;Wild
man:&rsquo; was it &lsquo;l&rsquo;om salvadegh&rsquo; or
&lsquo;salvan&rsquo; or &lsquo;orco?&rsquo; I cannot think it was
&lsquo;gigante.&rsquo; But all is left to conjecture. Among the few
bits of Italian he does give are two or three &lsquo;tags&rsquo; to
stories, among them the one I met so continually in Rome &lsquo;Larga
la foglia&rsquo;&mdash;(it was still &lsquo;foglia&rsquo; and not
&lsquo;voglia&rsquo;) word for word.</p>

thought this one of the best specimen tales, as the two stories of the
Three Wishes and the Three Faithful Beasts are leading ones in every
popular mythology. I have named a good many variants in connexion with
their counterparts in the <i>Folklore of Rome</i>, and a more extensive
survey of them, together with a most interesting analysis of their
probable origin, will be found in Cox&rsquo;s <i>Mythology of Aryan
Nations</i>, vol. i. pp. 144 and 375. I had thought that these, being
strung together in the text version, was owing to a freak of memory of
some narrator who, having forgotten the original conclusion of the
former story, takes the latter one into it; but, curiously enough, in
the note to the last-named page of Mr. Cox&rsquo;s work, he happens
actually to establish an intrinsic identity of origin in the two
stories. The Three Wishes story has also a strangely localized home in
the Oetzthal, which, though properly belonging to the division of North
Tirol, I prefer to cite here, for the sake of its analogies. Its
particular home is in the so-called Thal Vent, on the frozen borders of
the Gletscher described by Weber, as appalling to a degree in its
loneliness, and in the roaring of its torrents, and the stern rugged
inaccessibility of its peaks. Here, he says, three Selige Fr&auml;ulein
(Weber, like Schneller, translates everything inexorably into German;
this may have been an Enguana) have their abode in a sumptuous
subterranean palace, which no mortal might reach. They are also called
<i lang="de">die drei Feyen</i>, he says, forming a further
identification with the normal legend, but he does not account for the
penetration of the French word into this unfrequented locality. They
were kind and ancillary to the poor mountain folk, but the dire enemies
of the huntsman, for he hunted as game the creatures who were their
domestic animals (here we have the nucleus of a heap of various tales
and legends of the pet creatures of fairies and hermits becoming the
intermediaries of supernatural communication). The Thal Vent legend
proceeds that a young shepherd once won the regard of the <i lang=
"de">drei Feyen</i>; they fulfilled all his wishes, and gave him
constant access to their palace under the sole condition that he should
never reveal its locality to any huntsman. After some years the youth
one day incautiously let out the secret to his father, and from
thenceforth the <i lang="de">drei Feyen</i> were inexorable in
excluding him from their society. He pleaded and pleaded all in vain,
and ultimately made himself a huntsman in desperation. But the first
time he took aim at one of their chamois, the most beautiful of the
three fairies appeared to him in so brilliant a light of glory, that he
lost all consciousness of his actual situation and fell headlong down
the precipice.</p>
